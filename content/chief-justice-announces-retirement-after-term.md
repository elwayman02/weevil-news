In an exclusive interview with Weevil News, Chief Justice James Tully has announced his intention to 
retire when his current term ends on September 1st of this year. When the two newest judges were 
elected recently, he informed the state representatives of his impending retirement. An official 
state announcement from the Governor is expected near the end of the month, with a specific date for 
his final day in office to be determined at that time.

As a lonely lawyer from New Austin, James Tully got the call to come up to the state judiciary as a 
judge. Willing to give it a try, he did the best he could with what he had in the fledgling days of 
our criminal justice system. His greatest achievement, the Chief Justice says, is taking a piece of 
paper with written laws and words and turning it into a form where everyone is treated equally, 
from the lowliest of persons working in the swamps with little to their name to the folks with fancy 
hats and more money than they know what to do with. Knowing that there are as many who curse his name 
in back alleys and out across the plains as those who'd like to see him stay on longer as Chief 
Justice, he hopes that he has helped all those he's encountered in his service to grow as much as 
they have helped him grow as a person and as a judge. He thanks everyone from the depths of his soul 
for that opportunity, truly.

Judge Tully feels honored to have helped establish a system where everyone could feel like equals 
before the law and to walk away with a solid footing for the judiciary to continue serving the 
people. He's very encouraged by the competence of his fellow judges, and was proud of the judges and 
state representatives he's worked with in his time as Chief Justice. Serving as a judge wasn't 
without its challenges, however. With over *SEVEN THOUSAND* residents throughout the state, there 
were many people who needed help and very few judges to help them. With only two judges actively 
serving, the need for their services may become overwhelming, though Justice Tully noted he's 
hopeful a third judge will be elected soon. He's encouraged the government to continue hiring to 
meet the needs of the people, so we can only hope that his advice and experience is heeded swiftly.

Looking forward to the future, James Tully sees himself moving on to better things. While he may 
get back into law practice at some point, he says other possibilities have been floated. Though he 
originally thought of it as a joke, a conversation with the President yielded the possibility of an 
ambassadorship, something he would strongly consider should it become a reality. In the meantime, 
however, he's excited about taking a nice long vacation to the island of Guarma. Having heard a lot 
about it during his term, he never had the opportunity to visit due to his commitments as Chief 
Justice and various personal matters occupying his time. He's spoken with Governor Devine and 
Attorney General Jefferson about taking a trip down there together, and Weevil News wishes Mr. Tully 
a relaxing time away from the state.

While judges are of course apolitical by nature of their work, Chief Justice Tully had some advice to 
share with the newly-elected Governor and State Representatives as they embark on their four-month 
terms. He suggests that they always keep an open ear and carefully consider all the possible decisions 
for the benefit of all of the people, not just the best decision for their own futures as politicians. 
Speaking to his colleagues in the judiciary, the Chief Justice left them with some final words of 
wisdom:

"Always ensure due diligence. Justice comes with a scale, not with a gun. Weigh everything, sometimes 
the evidence may not be what you think. Take a firm hand, but at the same time have an open ear."

Wise words from a wise man, indeed.
