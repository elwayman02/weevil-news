After spending two wonderful weeks visiting her cousins in New Alexandria, 
Lady Violet Davies has announced her plans to return to her lovely home in England. 
While she would have been delighted to extend her stay, it has come to the Dowager 
Countess' attention that the many boards she sits on at home are in desperate 
need of her attendance.

As the Lady's presence is incomparable to her peers, there can be no sating this need 
other than to journey back to British lands. She has made plans to embark post-haste, 
arranging passage on the next reasonably accommodating passenger vessel out of 
Saint Denis.

She has found her time here quite educational, if not always enjoyable; a truly 
enlightening experience to be sure. Lady Violet wishes well her many friends and 
acquaintances here in America, as there are surely many left behind who will mourn 
her absence.
