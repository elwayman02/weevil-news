If there's one thing I cannot lie about, it's that I like big bottoms, especially those from 
Lemoyne Fried Chicken Company. No man or brother out there can deny that the delightful sight of them 
next to some small biscuits just makes you want to spring them into your face! Even the toughest 
fellows can't help but notice how Mr. Sanders stuffs those juicy bottoms full of flavor, and those 
delicious bites are sure to settle deep into your hips whether you're wearing trousers or brand 
new Levi Strauss jeans!

Once you get hooked on these bottoms, you won't be able to stop staring as they sizzle in front of you. 
Lemoyne Chicken Company's signature product is so popular that some customers have been known to ask 
for a photograph with their favorite piece, despite warnings that they might burn themselves from 
touching those bottoms too quickly. Once they've cooled down, however, the rumpled, smooth, and crispy 
skin is perfect for handling even while in the fanciest stagecoach.

Mr. Sanders' bottoms aren't your average group of chickens, no sirree! We've seen them dancing in the 
sizzling hot oil, so mesmerizing that couples have been known to throw romance out the window, they 
were so turned on by the sight. These bottoms sweat in the milk and egg wash, spinning through 
the mixing bowl like a turbo top until they're wet. 

If you're tired of reading about flat, lifeless fried chicken, take an average customer at Lemoyne 
Fried Chicken and ask them about their experience! They'll all tell you that a great company will 
pack as much flavor back into those bottoms as they can. So fellows, are you going to get your 
girlfriends a juicy bottom? Just ask Mr. Sanders to shake them in his special blend of secret herbs 
and spices until they get a nice healthy coating!

Now, I don't know about you, but I like them bottom as round and big as they come. When I'm working a 
gig, I just can't help myself but tear into a juicy bottom like I'm an animal on the hunt. Now, I'm 
going to let you in on the real scandal; sometimes I like to take them home and eat *TWO* bottoms at 
once! That's right, I double up on those bottoms, but I ain't playing with 'em like a boy with his 
toys.

I just want 'em real thick and juicy, so if you find a couple juicy bottoms Mortimer's in trouble. I 
will literally beg you for a piece, especially if there's a nice crispy bubble in the skin. Sometimes, 
I look at round rocks and think I see juicy bottoms just knocking around the ground, but you can 
have those fake mirages, because I keep to the real, flowing juices of Lemoyne Chicken Company.

A word to those who have thick bottoms in their soul; I'm with you. I'm not going to cuss about it, 
but I've gotta be straight about the fact that I just want to bite into these bottoms from dusk 
until dawn. Mr. Sanders really has something special going on here, and while his competitors won't 
like to hear it, they're just quitters who won't stick it out and put in the time it takes to build 
a long industrious career based on a strong product.

So, ladies, if you're ready for some juicy bottoms of your own, turn your fancy wagons around and 
roll on up to Valentine. Stick it out through the long lines, because even those with the blandest 
of taste buds are shouting about these juicy bottoms. Lemoyne Fried Chicken Company's got it back 
in stock today!
