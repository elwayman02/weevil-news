A revolution in transportation is sweeping New Alexandria as two entrepreneurs 
joined forces to create Mortabello's, The Portable Fellows! Co-Founders Mortimer Rivers 
and Goey Portabello have combined their business ventures to provide superior service 
for their customers.

Prior to founding this new business, Mortimer Rivers was the proprietor of Parcel Express, 
a competitor of Portabello Portables. After realizing the improvements that could be made by 
working together, the two businessmen have decided to work together on this new venture. 
They will also be hiring more employees in the near future to increase their availability 
for potential customers. They will be operating offices out of Valentine (the old Freight Station) 
and Saint Denis (TBD) or can be reached by telegram to arrange new business.

Mortabello's will be providing a wide array of services, including delivery of parcels, 
goods, and provisions, transportation of valuables, wilderness tours, and more. Going out 
on a hunting trip or searching for gold? Hire Mortabello's to bring your wares back to town 
to sell on your behalf. All business is kept strictly confidential, so you can count on 
The Portable Fellows to be at your side!
