Winifred Lockheart is a polarizing figure in New Alexandria. Known to many as the owner of the Library 
in Saint Denis (formerly Strawberry), she is also known as a former outlaw and pirate. Though she 
has paid her dues and put her criminal past behind her, there are many who still see Miss Winnie as 
an enemy of the state. However, she believes that her experience on both sides of the law gives her 
a unique perspective that can be leveraged to the benefit of all people throughout the state.

She believes that the scales of justice, the economy, and the social status of the people of New 
Alexandria are all out of balance, and she seeks to restore stability and equity for all. Miss 
Lockheart believes our criminal justice system is in need of reform, but she has not taken a 
prescriptive approach in this regard. Rather than claim that she knows every change that needs to take 
place, she instead plans to sit down with our law enforcement to review their standard operating 
procedures, ensuring that all civilians are treated fairly and in accordance with the law, regardless 
of innocence or presumed guilt.

Another concern she raised was the ability for convicted criminals to rehabilitate and pay their dues 
to society. The size of the fines levied for most crimes requires individuals to hunt day in and day 
out to earn enough money to pay back the state, leaving no funds leftover for their own well-being. 
This, of course, leads to a rash of over-hunting, threatening to upset the balance of nature in our 
fair state. There are very few, if any, alternative jobs that pay well enough to resolve a fine 
within the allotted time period, at which point further fines and time in Sisika are levied against 
those who cannot pay. 

Miss Winnie believes that all people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect; in our interview 
she pointed to a recent event where an under-sheriff received a mere one-week suspension for beating a 
woman within an inch of her life while in the custody of law enforcement. She pointed out that if an 
officer with less seniority had committed such an act, they would have lost their badge immediately, 
raising concerns of consistent accountability within the department. All of these issues need to be 
resolved if we are to expect our justice system to assist people in turning away from their criminal 
pasts.

Returning to the question of providing citizens with viable career paths beyond hunting, this 
candidate had a strong answer. She intends to pursue government grants for licensed businesses, 
enabling business owners to invest in hiring more employees and providing jobs that can sustain 
people financially. She wants state taxes as well as her own income to be directed toward 
funding for small businesses such as butchers, saloons, gambling halls, and more. Miss Lockheart 
believes these grants are especially important for businesses that operate in the public interest 
rather than purely for profit, such as newspapers, libraries, schools, and so on. 

In fact, she has already heavily invested in the education and reading literacy of New Alexandrians. 
As the owner of a library, she provides books for citizens to check out for learning and entertainment. 
She organizes classes for people to learn to read, a skill that is valuable for people to increase 
their earning capacity, run their own businesses, and be more involved in our modern society. Weevil 
News applauds increased literacy as a laudable goal for our state government, and one that very few 
candidates appear to be focused on in this election.

Miss Lockheart points out that, as a candidate, she has a unique perspective from multiple walks of 
life. She has seen both sides of the laws, having been a former criminal but also seeing the good work 
that our deputies can do. Who better to raise the visibility of our justice issues and lead the state 
toward more equitable solutions than someone who can truly understand both sides? Whether criminal, 
civilian, or state employee, she believes that all people deserve an equal voice in our government. 
After all, that is what makes this country great.

People should not be judged by the transcript of their past, she says. One cannot determine a person's 
worth by what's written down on paper; it is their actions and how they carry themselves in the public 
eye that shows who they truly are. Having become disillusioned with the criminal life since the death 
her captain, Miss Winnie has reinvented herself as a caring public citizen, investing her time and 
money in the public interest while staying clear of further misdeeds. She merely asks that the public 
judge her for who she is today, who she has become and tries to be for the future.

As Governor, Miss Lockheart plans to strike a different path from the position's current occupant. 
While legislation has moved slowly due to a disconnect between the legislature and the governor, who 
has been difficult to communicate and slow to sign bills, she intends to repair that relationship. 
She also pointed out that over-focus on the Wapiti treaty left the government unable to address the 
needs of its own people. While she respects the need to treat the natives respectfully, she does 
not see it as healthy that the people of New Alexandria were neglected for nearly an entire term. 

Miss Winnie believes that a governor should meet regularly with their legislators and be prepared 
to sign bills into law the same day they are passed by the legislature. The more efficiently the 
government moves to enact laws that have been agreed upon, the sooner its citizens can benefit 
from the work their elected representatives are doing. The government should stand united together, 
working for the people. To that end, she endorses Ada Lockwood and Henry Clerk for state 
representative in this election.

Winifred's heart lies with the people. It always has, and it always will. She looks at the people 
around her and seeks to treat them with the same respect she wishes to receive. She believes all 
people should be seen as equal, and her fight for her own respect in the eyes of the people mirrors 
her desire to see the same for all of New Alexandria. As she said, "I am still held down, but these 
chains will not hold me down. I will rise up!"
