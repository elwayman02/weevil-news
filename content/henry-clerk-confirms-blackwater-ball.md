Sources have indicated to Weevil News plans to host the grandest event West Elizabeth has ever seen. 
Dubbed the Blackwater Ball, this appears to be the brainchild of newly elected Representative-Elect 
Henry Clerk. We were recently able to speak with the man himself to confirm these plans. He's working 
to finalize details of this venture as part of his larger efforts to get people down to Blackwater 
and engage in the local community.

The ball appears to be centered around the Black Dog Saloon, where there will be drinking, dancing, 
and blackjack throughout the night. This will be part of a larger series of regular events held at 
the saloon, twice a week on Fridays and either Mondays or Wednesdays. However, this night in 
particular will have even more pleasantries in store. Our sources gave light to the possibility of 
boat rides and even fireworks, making this truly a night with wonders in store.

While the Blackwater Ball does not yet have a confirmed time and date, expectations are that it may 
occur in mid to late September. That is not the only event in the works, we learned from 
Representative-Elect Clerk. New Alexandrians can expect a special celebration of his historic and 
decisive victory to be announced soon. It will surely be an opportunity to celebrate the community 
that came together and lifted him to new heights as their legislator!
