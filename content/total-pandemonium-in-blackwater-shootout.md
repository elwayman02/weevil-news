Monday night, the streets of Blackwater were awash with chaos as gunfire erupted in the center of town. 
Riding in from the north, a posse of deputies descended upon the populace, guns blazing. The first 
victim was a startled yokel riding around the corner near the construction site. He pulled his gun in 
fright and was quickly taken down by the law enforcement swarm. They then spread down the main street, 
looking for their prey.

Witnesses described hearing gunfire near the recently closed Black Dog Saloon, coming in a constant 
barrage as deputies apparently engaged their quarry. White hats and other figures were spotted running 
through rooftops and through construction, dodging and shooting at each other. The scene was described 
as pure chaos, a truly unforeseen sight in Blackwater.

As things quieted down, witnesses saw Lady Corvus sneaking along the waterfront roofs, eventually 
reaching a horse and riding off into the hills. Moments later, an unidentified man jumped off the roof 
onto the back of a deputy's horse, apparently stealing it as he disappeared in the distance. It's 
currently unknown if either of these individuals were directly involved in the shooting or if there 
were any others engaging with law enforcement.

Deputies roamed the down for quite some time afterward, apparently oblivious to anyone and everything 
moving through the scene. Witnesses described being ignored as people snuck through the alleys to 
get closer to the area. Law enforcement even allowed people to approach them immediately after the 
shooting without investigating to see if they were involved. 

Weevil News was unable to contact law enforcement for comment, as they were locked inside the 
Blackwater jail for hours after the incident. Regardless of who was involved or why it took place, one 
thing is clear; this was one of the most spectacular gunfights Blackwater has ever seen!
