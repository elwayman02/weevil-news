Mato Hanska loved his horse, Whichahpi. A beautiful Missouri Fox Trotter, she would receive 
compliments from strangers all the time. Rider and horse were hardly separable, a pair that cared 
for each other and went everywhere together. That is, until the untimely passing of Mr. Hanska's 
beloved mount, the second horse he's lost since coming to New Alexandria. What follows is his 
personal account of the events that led to this tragic death, not a statement of fact by Weevil 
News, who has been unable to reach the person allegedly responsible for this incident for 
comment.

As a security professional, Mato works hard to protect others, and that's what he was doing on 
Sunday, August 23rd. Coming back from Cumberland Forest, he had been passing through Valentine on 
his way to the Wapiti reservation. He'd heard that two of his friends had been hit by a train, and 
that one of them may have been taken north for treatment by natives in the area. Though he was 
concerned for the safety of his friends, Mr. Hanska made sure to ride carefully through town so as 
not to be a danger to anyone on the road or suffer the withering injunction of vigilant deputies.

As he was riding through the intersection near the graveyard on the east end of town, Mato says that 
he came to a stop to let traffic pass and suddenly heard a rumbling approaching. The next moment, he 
saw Undersheriff Jack Burton fly out of nowhere on a small hunting cart, swerving through the road 
at incredible speeds. Having already stopped at the intersection, he was unable to move his horse 
before the cart plowed into them both, sending Mr. Hanska flying. The last thing he remembers is 
being carried into the doctor's office by Mr. Burton before he passed out from his injuries.

When he woke up, Mato learned the horrible news; his horse had been killed in the collision. When he 
spoke with the deputies later, he told Undersheriff Burton and another deputy that he wanted to look 
at their reports of the incident in order to ensure that it reflect his own recollection of events. 
It was at this time he was informed that there was no report due to no crime being committed, though 
it was threatened that they could write Mr. Hanska up for "obstruction of justice". Apparently, the 
Undersheriff had been chasing down and shooting at a local, and he considered the collision an 
attempt by Mato to interfere with his duties as law enforcement.

That was not the only threat that was allegedly made, however. Mato claims that Mr. Burton threatened 
to have Sheriff Jackson take him down to the swamp and shoot him, though it's not clear why such a 
threat would be made by an officer of the law. Regardless, with the Undersheriff refusing to 
compensate him for the loss of his horse and no report being written of the incident, Mr. Hanska felt 
compelled to file a civil action to receive recompense.

This case, Mato Hanska v. Jack Burton, has been scheduled to take place on Thursday, September 3rd, 
at 3 pm by the Eastern clocks. The arguments will be heard by Chief Justice Underwood in District 4, 
at the Bastille Courthouse in Saint Denis. The plaintiff will be represented by Joshua "JD" Holliday, 
while Undersheriff Burton appears to have decided to represent himself. At one point Attorney General 
Alexander Jefferson was involved in the matter, but the judge ruled that the Sheriff's Office itself 
could not be sued. At that point, he recused himself from the matter after it was also ruled that 
Mr. Burton could not be classified as an "agent of the state" in this context and thus immune from 
liability for these events. Mr. Holliday also extended a public settlement offer to Mr. Burton to 
avoid going to court, but that appears to have been rejected as the case is moving forward at this 
time. 

Despite the alleged actions in this civil case, Mr. Hanska would like to make it clear that he 
doesn't begrudge Undersheriff Burton doing his job. He feels that there was no malice in the incident; 
that the collision was an honest mistake by the defendant. He merely wishes to be compensated for 
the loss given the alleged fault of Mr. Burton, hoping that he realizes that anyone can make mistakes 
and should own up to them. Even if he doesn't win, he hopes to shed light on potential abuses of 
power where members of the Sheriff's Office act as if they can do no wrong even when they have made a 
clear mistake. He believes that such actions make it harder for the other deputies to do their jobs 
and command the respect they deserve for their hard work.

The people demanded reform from its government in who they elected this month, and it's about time 
we see that take effect, Mr. Hanska says. Regardless, it is now up to the courts and Chief Justice 
Underwood to seek the truth and a fair ruling on this matter. Weevil News is certain that the 
statements of Mr. Hanska, Mr. Burton, and the named witnesses will reveal the truth of this matter, 
and it will be resolved fairly to the satisfaction of all.
