The delicious food from Lemoyne Fried Chicken Company (LFC) is flying off the counter faster than its 
owner, Mr. Sanders, can fry it. Since opening over the last two weeks, this quaint food stand across 
from the butcher in Valentine has taken off like a horse in heat. It seems folks just can't get enough 
of his succulent breasts and juicy bottoms, which is why he needs your help!

LFC is starting a massive hiring push, looking to rapidly expand their operations to handle 
unprecedented demand. In addition to the long lines trailing across the street to the hotel every day, 
Mr. Sanders has also received numerous large catering orders for events of thirty or more people! As 
the lone chef handling every facet of the business, his newfound success has created quite the demand 
for workers.

If you're in the market for a new job, this could be the opportunity for you! Whether you're a clerk, 
salesperson, chef, or otherwise skilled, LFC has a place for you. They'll need people breading, frying,
and boxing that chicken as fast as possible to handle the orders coming in day and night. Those who 
have skill with a frying pan will be well-rewarded, as its dangerous work that could burn a hand or 
singe some eyebrows.

In particular, Mr. Sanders wants people who will caress the breasts with care and make sure the bottoms 
are extra plump. A lot of folks find juicy bottoms distracting, he says, and they just wanna sink 
their teeth in right then and there. Instead, those bottoms must be kneaded properly in the egg wash, 
ensuring they are fully covered before they hit the frying pan.

If you think you have what it takes, make sure to inquire about the plethora of job openings available 
today! Mr. Sanders is a proud member of the Valentine community, and he's happy to be an employer to 
many of the fine, skilled folk in this town. Don't miss this opportunity to earn your living working 
for the Lemoyne Fried Chicken Company!
