The legend of Lefty Lone has echoed across New Alexandria for decades. 
Rumor has it that the government has been after him for 40 years, trying to get 
their hands on the riches he has hidden in the mountains. Refusing to abide 
by the dollar, Lefty insists on paying with gold, leading others to wonder 
where he gets it from.

After decades of chasing him down, the law finally got their hands on Lefty Lone 
several days ago. Sources say he was sentenced to an astronomical 1,930 months in Sisika, 
supposedly for simple robberies and shootouts with deputies. Lefty, of course, has 
been innocent for the last 40 years, as we hear it, yet the rumors of his crimes have 
curiously spread throughout the populace.

The rumors about his stay in Sisika get even more interesting, however. It's said that 
Lefty escaped within half an hour of arriving at the prison, using his dinner to bribe a guard 
to leave the gate cracked open for him. Lefty took to swimming for the far shore, but he soon 
realized that the strong current would drag him under before he got far. Returning to the 
prison beach, he waited patiently until a canoe passed by, commandeering it for his escape. 
Though the occupants protested, Lefty showed them his fist and ever since they've been missed.

Though the people appear confident in Lefty Lone's innocence, there is little doubt that his 
upcoming court case won't go his way. Rumors say that he's not aiming to show up at all, 
retiring to Tumbleweed to care for himself, his horse, and his legendary beard. Those who 
know Lefty best say he has but one message for the government: "Hear Ye, Hear Ye, Lefty Lone 
Needs To Be Left Alone".
