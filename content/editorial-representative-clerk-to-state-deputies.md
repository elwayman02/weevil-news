I have a question to pose to the people of New Alexandria. When you see a white hat walking towards you 
from down the street, what do you feel? What do you think? Are you happy to see a Deputy? Perhaps not. 
Perhaps you are bracing yourself for a scolding about this or that ordinance. Perhaps you see a parade 
of white hats, and are anticipating yet another pompous show of stature from our soon-to-be former 
Governor Devine, whose greatest achievement in office will be making it three feet out the door before 
stopping to catch his breath. Perhaps you are lucky to even see a Deputy at all. Perhaps, like me, you 
spend your days harassed and harangued by Outlaws and ne’er-do-wells who are free to rob and murder as 
they please, so long as they remove their long arms whilst in Strawberry and pet the dog in Rhodes. 

I ask you this, my fellow citizens, not to besmirch the good names of honorable, stalwart deputies. I 
ask you this because for far too long I have experienced and witnessed that despite there being many 
honorable, stalwart deputies within our Sheriff’s Departments, the House in which they reside has been 
built with rotting, molded wood. I am writing this “editorial” of sorts to call upon my fellow 
citizens, my fellow Representatives, and those good, honorable deputies to speak loudly and clearly 
about the systemic flaws within the Sheriff’s Departments. 

Yesterday as of the writing of this letter, I was visiting St. Denis with my very good friends in order 
to celebrate. We made merry, and all was well. As part of this merriment, we had all decided to dress 
fancifully, and some of us were wearing costumes and masks. Whilst we were enjoying some games in the 
Theatre, no less than four deputies approached our group and harassed us with regard to the masks we 
were wearing. I was not wearing my mask, and so I approached and explained the situation to them. To 
their credit, they accepted my explanation and we parted ways.

A short time later, while making our way to the Bastille for drinks, we were again harassed, this time 
by people on horseback wielding shotguns. Imagine my surprise, dear readers, when in the course of 
these events not a single white hat could be seen. My life, that of a State Representative-Elect, as 
well as the lives of my close and dear friends was put in grave danger and when we needed help the 
most, none could be found. I will note for the record that those individuals that accosted us were 
wearing bandanas to cover their face, which I assume must not be covered in the ordinance that 
dictates party-goers remove their masks. 

If this was the first and only instance of justice in this state failing on almost every conceivable 
level, I would not have written this letter. I am not a confrontational man, but I was elected to 
speak on the behalf of the people of New Alexandria and that is exactly what I intend to do. If the 
bluntness of my remarks causes offense, perhaps then the issue is not with my remarks. Those who know 
me, or know of me, have heard that I spend my days in the beautiful town of Blackwater. I have met 
many friends there. I have provided aid and comfort to everyone who comes through the doors of the 
Saloon. I have also seen good people driven from a good place because Outlaws, Murderers, and Thieves 
see easy prey. There is more snow on the ground in Blackwater than there are deputies. Is it a 
surprise to anyone then, that absent the help of any lawful officer, citizens of this State have 
taken justice into their own hands on occasion? 

Change is hard, my friends. Change is also needed desperately in this case. I refuse to feel unsafe 
in my own home. I refuse to wonder who will rob or shoot me if I walk down the street alone. I refuse 
to allow a system which profits from, as Governor Devine put it recently “Obtaining Guilty verdicts”, 
to flourish. I was not elected to defend or represent such a system. I was elected to defend and 
represent the people that system has abandoned. A badge on your chest is not a right to enforce 
the law selectively or to harass good and honest folk. A badge on your chest is a promise to protect 
and defend the people and to uphold the law in all instances. In closing, my message to anyone who 
wears a badge and a white hat in order to spend their days collecting bail money and swinging their 
weight around while ignoring the cries of the people they have sworn to protect is quite simple: Quit.

Best Regards, 

H. Clerk
