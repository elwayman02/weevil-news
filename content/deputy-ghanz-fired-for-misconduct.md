Commonly referred to in Valentine as "Deputy Dickhead", Rafael Ghanz was far from anyone's 
favorite lawman. He was known, not for stopping violent crimes, but for harassing folks 
who were just minding their own business. When he wasn't blackout drunk, Mr. Ghanz was 
creepily watching people from the balconies of Valentine or searching their property 
without cause.

Furthermore, it has come to the attention of Weevil News that, as a deputy, Mr. Ghanz was 
assigned to patrols in the Eastern District of New Alexandria. Yet, instead of being commonly 
seen in Rhodes or Saint Denis, he would be lounging around Valentine despite a distinct lack 
of actionable crimes taking place in that town at the time.

Even worse, Mr. Ghanz had taken a particular disliking to the younger folk around Valentine. 
There are countless stories that go beyond harassment, such as when he nearly cut open a 
young man's horse in search of supposed "contraband", despite no clear reason to suspect 
such existed. While there is no official statement from the Sheriff's Office as to the reason, 
Mr. Ghanz was fired on Friday, leaving the public service. Public statement or no, the public 
certainly need not search far in its own memories for justification.

The firing played out in a very public scene, as Mr. Ghanz took to the main street of Valentine 
to voice his objections. Facing down two other deputies, he was heard yelling "I might as well 
just become a criminal now" and, later, "You're lucky I have $1,000, or I'd have to turn to a 
life of crime". He rode off at full speed through the streets of Valentine, yelling at any and 
all in his path about how they never deserved him.

That wasn't the last we heard of him that day, however. Mr. Ghanz decided to put his displeasure 
on full display, sending a telegram from Flatneck Station sometime later. It read: "*YOU CAN TAKE 
AWAY MY BADGE..* STOP *BUT I WONT GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO TAKE ME OUT TOO...* STOP *YOU CAN THANK 
GEORGE COOK AND JAMES WALTER FOR THIS..* FULLSTOP"

Regardless of the reasons his colleagues had for removing the badge, it's clear that Deputy Ghanz 
has deeper problems that need to be addressed. The state of New Alexandria is safer without his 
gun and demeanor tarnishing the badge he wore, and Weevil News applauds this move to restore the 
trust we have in our law enforcement.
