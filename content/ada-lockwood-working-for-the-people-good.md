Running for State Representative in the upcoming elections, Ada "Dove" Lockwood hopes to be a new kind 
of representative. She aims to listen to all people of the state, representing their concerns and 
not just her own. Instead of making specific promises and policy changes out of the gate, Miss Lockwood 
is running a different campaign.

Her number one priority as a candidate is to seek out different perspectives among her prospective 
constituents. She understands that her life experiences can only take her so far; as a politician, 
she needs to demonstrate that she can listen as much as she can speak. If anyone has concerns about 
their quality of life, experiences, livelihoods, or anything else impacting them throughout the 
upcoming four-month term, Miss Lockwood is willing to listen for as long as they're willing to speak 
about their own perspectives.

As a farrier herself, Ada has a lot of empathy for the skilled craftsmen, artisans, and tradefolk of 
New Alexandria. Hardworking folk with manual jobs are often passed over, both politically and in terms 
of financial viability. She believes in encouraging job diversity and success in all career paths. 
While acknowledging that this is not necessarily a legislative concern, Miss Lockwood nonetheless 
believes that a state representative should be a leader and encourage prosperity for all people.

While hunting is very popular in New Alexandria and constitutes good, noble, hard work, many folk are 
driven to the work through necessity rather than desire. Ada believes that all careers should be 
financially viable, and people should be able to follow their dreams, pursuing careers they care about. 
She intends to bring that perspective and experience to the legislature as a champion of the people.

Another concern that Ada Lockwood has about the current state of our fair community is the relationship 
between the people and their law enforcement. She has heard many reports about people not getting the 
treatment their deserve while in deputy custody. While she believes deputies are noble, hardworking 
folk, she would like to see more oversight to protect the rights of citizens. She seeks an expansion 
the availability of legal counsel, making sure those incarcerated know their rights.

Trials should be conducted expediently, she says, rather than folk serving full sentences prior to 
even going before a judge. While she declined to comment on whether those ultimately deemed innocent 
should be provided restitution for falsely served time, Miss Lockwood stated a preference for at least 
a public acknowledgement of the accused's innocence. The state should seek to provide closure for 
these folk and their families so that they can continue to trust in the good work of law enforcement in 
New Alexandria.

Ada Lockwood is serious about being a representative that understands the concerns of her people. She 
is proud to have the endorsement of the New Alexandria Horse Racing Association as well as Ford & Sons, 
a real honor she wasn't expecting. She welcomes any and all folk who would like to speak with her 
and help her learn from their perspectives throughout the campaign and the future if she were to be 
elected!
