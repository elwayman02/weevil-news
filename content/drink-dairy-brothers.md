There's nothing more satisfying than a fresh glass of milk from a local dairy farm. 
That's exactly why Reginald (known as Red) and Marty opened up their ranch two weeks ago, 
bringing access to fresh dairy products throughout New Alexandria. Known as Dairy Brothers
& Co, you can be sure their wagon will happily deliver anywhere there's a customer!

This humble ranch comes from grassroots beginnings, focusing on producing the freshest milk 
from grass-fed, free-range cattle purchased right here in New Alexandria. As a local 
business, they ensure all their cattle and feed comes from other local businesses, rather 
than importing products from out of state. You can be sure that any money you spend with 
Dairy Brothers will stay here within the state.

While their primary business is selling fresh milk for an outrageously low price of 
*ONE DOLLAR* per jug, Dairy Brothers also sell beef occasionally when one of their cattle 
needs to be retired. They may also have sausages available soon, so keep an eye out to 
pick them up before they're gone. These hardworking ranchers are happy to accommodate 
specialty needs and large orders, so don't hesitate to let them know if you'd like to 
stray outside their usual catalogue.

Dairy Brothers is looking to expand their business to clientele throughout New Alexandria, 
so make sure to keep an eye out on the local notice boards to see when their wagons 
are operating. Their primary operations are located in District Two, so head on over that 
way to pick up the freshest milk around!
