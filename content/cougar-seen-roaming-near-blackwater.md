Weevil News has received reports of a cougar uncharacteristically roaming the open plains 
west of Blackwater. As a cat most commonly seen in the woodlands and mountain passes, 
wagoneers from the Riders Union were surprised to see one running through open fields. 

The cougar has run up on multiple wagons and riders in the area, seeking easy prey in a 
land where it can't sneak up on local deer and wildlife due to the long, open sightlines.
There have been no fatalities reported as of yet, but it will likely become desperate 
as food becomes more scarce.

Upon interviewing travelers and Blackwater residents, Weevil News heard much speculation 
as to why the cougar has come this close to town. The most likely theory seems to be related 
to the storms rolling up from New Austin; lightning-spurred fires in Tall Trees may have 
driven the cougar from its home onto the Great Plains.

Local hunters should take note if they plan to seek deer and other game in the area. 
Keep your head on a swivel for this cougar, which may be lying in wait for the unwary 
to be bent over a kill before it tries to strike. Brave thrill-seekers would be doing 
a great service to Blackwater by hunting down this menace before someone truly gets hurt!
