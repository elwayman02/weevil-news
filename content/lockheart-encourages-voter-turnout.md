Speaking with gubernatorial candidate Winifred Lockheart after the election results were released 
Monday, Weevil News learned that her focus is more on a successful runoff than her own campaign. 
While she's elated by the support that catapulted her into a runoff with fellow candidate Addison 
Flanagan, Miss Winnie has made it a priority to encourage strong turnout in this weekend's follow-up 
voting.

While turnout was decent for the election last weekend, Miss Lockheart knows for a fact that there 
are more people in this state who need to have their voices heard. While many were able to make the 
trip down to Saint Denis, not all folks were able to cast their vote. Miss Winnie would like to 
ensure as many as possible are able to express their perspectives in this runoff, whether they 
support her or her opponent.

That's why Winifred Lockheart has decided to sponsor FREE transportation down to Saint Denis from 
anywhere in the state. She knows that traveling long distances can be dangerous and tiring, so she's 
made arrangements with the Riders Union to ferry voters to the polls. Union businesses like the Red 
Fox Express and Mortabello's The Portable Fellows will be on stand by throughout the weekend, so 
please approach any union member to request a complimentary ride to cast your vote!

Speaking of the certified results, Miss Winnie said she is extremely happy that Henry Clerk and 
Ada Lockwood were victorious in their campaigns for State Representative, but she believes there are 
even more voices yet to be heard. With these runoffs, everyone still has the chance to ensure they 
are represented in our new government. Speaking of ways to increase turnout in the future, she 
mentioned wanting to establish additional voting locations so that voters would not have to leave 
their counties to vote all the way in Saints Denis.

As Winifred Lockheart always says "Do not be afraid of your government, we are only here to help you. 
If we do a shit job, you can take us back out again." She encourages everyone to do their civic duty 
and make their voices heard. No matter who you support in this election, you deserve to have a chance 
to show that support at the polls. Express your opinion, New Alexandria depends on it!
