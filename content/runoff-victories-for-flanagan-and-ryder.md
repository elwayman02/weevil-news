The ballots have been cast, and the results are in; Addison Flanagan is your new Governor, New 
Alexandria. Alongside the fiery Ramona Ryder, these two women claimed a close victory in the runoff 
elections last weekend. After a hard-fought campaign left voters undecided between four possible 
candidates across two positions, our state was asked to voice its preference once again to break the 
ties that had resulted.

For the position of Governor, Addison Flanagan faced off against Winifred Lockheart, who she had 
bested by a mere *NINETEEN* votes in the general election while falling shy of the 50% needed to 
secure victory. In a victory that confirmed the same results, Miss Flanagan yet again secured a 
nineteen vote advantage in the runoff. This close race underscored how truly divided the people were 
between two highly respected and qualified candidates.

The shift in the race for State Representative, however, was more profound. Coming from a literal 
deadlock where both Elylida Beaumonte and Ramona Ryder gained *EXACTLY* the same number of votes, 
Miss Ryder managed to command a 60% share of the vote, a clear victory for her campaign platform. 
The two candidates had campaigned alongside one another and Miss Flanagan in the general election, 
but voters were forced to choose between them as only one seat remained in the legislature.

These victories solidify the shape of the New Alexandria government for the next four months. Miss 
Flanagan and Miss Ryder join Mr. Henry Clerk and Miss Ada Lockwood to round out our elected officials 
for the new term. Weevil News was able to speak with Representative Clerk this weekend to get his 
thoughts on the runoff results.

He extended his heartfelt sympathies to Elylida Beaumonte and Winifred Lockheart, two women he 
considers his very dear friends. While it may feel like they lost, he rightfully pointed out that 
they both had broad support from voters and that support does not disappear when the election ends. 
He hopes that they realize this and continue to work for the good of the people in their future 
endeavors. Mr. Clerk noted that Miss Beaumonte has a bright career and future as a doctor, and he 
hopes that Miss Winnie finds her purpose, sticks to it, and doesn't get discouraged by this setback.

To his new colleagues in government, Mr. Clerk expressed excitement. As shining and brilliant 
examples of what a person and a politician should be, he looks very much forward to working with them 
both. He believes them to be more than ready to handle the tremendous task ahead of this new 
government, and he cannot wait to get to work on the many matters of import before them. 
Representative Clerk extended his thanks to the voters that were patient and consistent throughout 
this historic and somewhat tumultuous election process. While it wasn't easy for anybody, he believes 
that getting through these last few weeks speaks volumes to the character of this state and its 
citizens.

Weevil News could not agree more with the sentiments Mr. Clerk shared with us. New Alexandria was 
blessed to have more qualified and passionate candidates than they could possibly elect, a problem 
that we can only wish for in future elections as well. We believe that the four officials 
representing our fair state will work hard to give voice to the people that elected them, and we 
hope fervently that they will fight just as hard for the ideals represented by Miss Lockheart and 
Miss Beaumonte, who enjoy the significant support of the people to this day. We wish our new state 
officials well as they step into these roles with clear minds and purpose.
