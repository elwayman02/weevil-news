The upcoming election for Governor of New Alexandria has people everywhere asking the same questions: 
Who are the candidates? Why are they running? What do they hope to accomplish? Why should I vote for them? 
Weevil News would love to help answer those questions!

If you intend to run for Governor of our fair state, please reach out to Mortimer Rivers or any other 
Weevil News employee to schedule an interview about your candidacy. We will endeavor to feature all 
candidates fairly, as we believe that visible and informed elections make for a successful political society. 

Weevil News may issue an endorsement of a candidate at a later date, but we will endeavor to interview all 
known candidates before deciding whether any deserve the support of our publication. Our readers know that we 
consider carefully the implications of any such endorsement and would never issue a statement like that lightly.

We would also love to hear from you, voters, about the upcoming election! Who are you supporting and why? What 
is important to you in a candidate? What do you think New Alexandria needs from its next leader? Contact Weevil News 
at our office in Valentine to share your thoughts on the gubernatorial election process.
