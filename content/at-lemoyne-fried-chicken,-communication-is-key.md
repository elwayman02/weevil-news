The delicious food at Lemoyne Fried Chicken doesn't come for free. Mr. Sanders and his crew work hard 
to keep their breasts plump and bottoms juicy, and there's nothing more important to them than open 
and honest communication in their work. If you're going to be handling lovely breasts on a daily 
basis, it's critical to ensure that everyone involved is on the same page.

The day starts by coming in the back door, where personnel await providing protection and safety for 
the incoming deliveries. They communicate with the load distributors to ensure everything ends up 
where it's supposed to be and that nothing unexpected gets snuck through the rear entrance. Once 
deliveries have been made, they hand the chicken over to the handlers who are responsible for 
preparing the product for the main event. These individuals lovingly caress the breasts, bottoms, 
and thighs, making sure they're washed and cared for. It's important to make sure nothing is left out; 
there must be plenty of communication to ensure full coverage and attention to every area.

Once the parts have been properly readied, that's when it's time to really dive in. The next employee 
carefully covers them in hot oils, paying special attention to the particulars specified by their 
partner who took care of preparation. Every breast and bottom is different; while LFC strives to keep 
them all plump and juicy, they also recognize that each requires special treatment to elicit the 
best response from their customers. Clear communication allows them to understand the specific 
dimensions they're working with, to ensure that the proper time and care has been spent in perfectly 
frying the product.

Finally, those working in the Missionary position must be in constant communication with their 
customers. Each customer has unique needs to be met, and their preferences will vary widely. A good 
Missionary can probe those needs with precision and delicate attention to detail, ensuring 
satisfaction every time. However, that end results starts from excellent communication. If you don't 
understand what they're asking for and what they really want, how can you properly service someone? 
That's the core question that drives Lemoyne Fried Chicken's approach to customer service, and it's 
why they are renowned for maintaining repeat business. Communication between the LFC family, its 
partners, and their customers is the key to their continued success!
