Weevil News is saddened to announce the passing of one Colt Wilder. On August 23rd, this unfortunate 
man was the victim of a horrible explosion in Blackwater. While trying to rescue his friend trapped 
in a carriage, Mr. Wilder was caught in an explosion emanating from the vehicle. He was rushed to the 
medical tent nearby for treatment, but he perished from his injuries.

While reports say that four to six others were incapacitated by the blast, it appears that no others 
were mortally wounded. Mr. Wilder's brave efforts managed to save his friend's life and many others 
who may have been killed in the blast had he not intervened. For his efforts, however, Colt lost an 
arm and a leg to the explosion, and his lungs collapsed from the impact. The injuries were too severe 
for doctors to save him, unfortunately.

Mr. Wilder's brother, Kano Wilds, shared a few words on the passing of his brother. Colt was a kind 
soul, he said, though they unfortunately hadn't seen each other since they were lads. Mr. Wilds had 
received a letter from his brother in the days before his death, prompting him to travel to Blackwater 
for a reunion. Sadly, he was unable to reach New Alexandria in time to see his brother alive. Weevil 
News extends our condolences to Mr. Wilds and the other friends and family of Mr. Colt Wilder, whose 
untimely passing is tragic indeed. His final moments proved the man to be a great friend, who even 
sacrificed his life for the protection of others. He will truly be missed.
