As one of the most popular drinking destinations in New Alexandria, the main street saloon in Valentine 
caters to locals, travelers, and thirsty hunters coming down from the slopes of Mount Hagen. This mainstay 
features a wide variety of liquors, from beer to brandy and whisky to wine. Its broad popularity leads quickly 
to a shortage in libations, which is why they're offering a job opportunity for any enterprising wagoneers!

Any driver with a strong back and keen sense of direction can stop by the back of the saloon to pick up an 
order contract to restock their shelves. Depending on current demand, you can either pick up lighter fare like 
beer and champagne down at Flatneck Station, or they'll ask you to lug down the stronger stuff like whisky and brandy 
from Emerald Station.

The owners of Valentine's saloons have long lobbied for direct deliveries to Valentine station, but the operators at 
Flatneck and Emerald stations were able to win contracts to handle these shipments in order to keep Valentine's station 
free for passengers and livestock only. These stations have plenty of warehouse and storage deck space to hold the 
orders until a delivery comes through, making them ideal partners in the alcohol shipping business.

If you're looking to pick up some work from the saloon, don't forget that they prefer the quality work of dues-paying 
union members. Inquire with the Riders Union for information on how you, too, can join this prestigious group of 
transportation and delivery professionals!
