When the list of certified candidates for governor was released last Tuesday, six individuals were 
named as having thrown their metaphorical hats in the ring. Curiously, however, one name was crossed 
out immediately, with "Disqualified" written next to it. That name was Winifred Lockheart.

Weevil News sought to investigate this immediate removal of a candidate from the election ballot, and 
we uncovered a story that only got stranger the deeper we looked. The official statement from those 
who certified the ballot was that Miss Winnie (as she is commonly known) was disqualified for 
conviction of a felony within the last 30 days, a requirement that had been made clear during the 
registration process. This seemed quite reasonable justification, until news came that this wasn't 
strictly the case.

It appears that Winifred Lockheart had been convicted of "Accomplice To First-Degree Murder", sometime 
over a month ago. The exact date is in dispute, with some sources claiming it occurred in late June 
and others reporting it as far back as the end of May. What is clear, however, is that the crime 
took place more than thirty days prior to the beginning of the campaign, making it ineligible for 
disqualification.

Even more curious, however, was the claim that said crime constituted a felony. While first-degree 
murder is in fact a felony, the penal code of New Alexandria clearly outlines that "Accomplice To" 
charges are misdemeanors. The only exception to this rule is in the case of an "aggravated felony", 
which sources indicate only applies to murder in the case of the victim being law enforcement or a 
government official. At this time, we have been unable to uncover any proof that the crime in question 
was aggravated in nature.

Furthermore, all reports we've had of the crime itself seem to indicate that she was charged as an 
"accomplice" simply for being present when the murder took place, despite many others being present 
who were not similarly charged. We've seen no evidence that Miss Winnie was carrying a weapon at the 
time or took any active part in the events leading up to the murder that took place, other than 
being a witness to its events.

Thus, it appears that the Governor and the Voting Committee responsible for certifying this election 
went out of their way to change a misdemeanor for which Winifred Lockheart served her time more than 
a month ago into a recent felony they could use to disqualify her from the election. It seems a 
desperate, questionable attempt to tilt the results of the election, and it backfired entirely. She 
engaged multiple lawyers to appeal this decision, and just this week was restored to the election 
ballot by the order of a judge.

It's been reported that several state representatives took stances aligned with this attempt to 
discourage her campaign. One was reported as saying she should quit running and stick to a lower 
position like representative. Another stated, "there's no way you'll ever get in, you're a criminal."
It appears that there is plenty of dislike for Winifred Lockheart in the halls of government today. 
Will the people flock to Winifred Lockheart's campaign over this injustice? Will they instead view her 
checkered past as an indictment of her character as the Governor and many others appear to think? 
We'll find out at the voting booth when the citizens of New Alexandria make their voices heard.
