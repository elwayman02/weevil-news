Three visionary entrepreneurs are breathing life into the culture of Saint Denis with the upcoming 
formation of Rocking Horse Entertainment. Dorian Granger, Sasha Stroganov, and Isabelle Tremblay have 
teamed up to launch this brand-new company aimed at re-establishing the city as a cultural center.

They'll begin operations at the Bastille Saloon this coming Saturday, welcoming all locals and 
travelers to stop in for food, drinks, singing, and dancing whenever they're seeking respite from 
their dreary toils and long travels. A premiere watering hole at the corner of the main square, the 
Bastille is considered one of the best entertainment destinations in Saint Denis.

That's not all, however. Rocking Horse Entertainment plans to look beyond the liquor business to 
coordinate a wide variety of events throughout the city and surrounding area. They'll be hosting 
"Story Time", reading various tales written by local authors. Gambling is another pastime you'll 
find at the saloon, including blackjack and dice games. From scavenger hunts to walking tours of 
Saint Denis, there will also be plenty of opportunities to explore the city as part of their events.

You can also keep an eye out for horse races and other exciting events in the works. The people of 
Saint Denis will experience a deluge of new activities once Rocking Horse Entertainment opens its 
doors. It's clear that these entertainment specialists will be keeping up a steady pace of excitement 
in the weeks and months to come!
