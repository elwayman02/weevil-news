New Hanover has a new paper of record as Weevil News opened its doors in Valentine 
this weekend. Helmed by veteran newspaperman Mortimer Rivers, it aims to bring a new 
information source to the central plains.

Mortimer comes to Valentine with years of experience, having written previously for 
The Saint Denis Times' sports section. As the paper's founder and editor, he plans to usher 
in a new era of newsworthiness to towns long-deemed irrelevant by more established papers.

"I believe that news can be found everywhere, not just in larger, so-called 'civilized' cities," 
said Mr. Rivers. "The people deserve to live informed lives, and Weevil News aims to provide them 
with that satisfaction!"

Weevil News plans to launch at just *ONE DOLLAR* an issue, making the paper accessible to any 
and all interested parties. They are also actively hiring salesmen, writers, and other employees. 
Inquire with Mortimer Rivers at their office in Valentine for more information!
