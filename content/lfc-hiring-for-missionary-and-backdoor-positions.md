As the chicken empire continues to grow, so does the girth of its customers. Mr. Sanders' delicious 
food stands prominently among the desires of Valentine patrons, and now he desires new partners in 
this explosive venture. The Lemoyne Fried Chicken Company has need of new workers to handle the 
growing need for their products in New Alexandria.

They're looking for hard workers to fill the Missionary position with vigor. While some see it as 
basic work, it is the bread and butter of their business. A good Missionary knows to push firmly, but 
not too hard, in order to keep customers desiring without turning them away from the experience. 
These workers are expected to be skilled in identifying the desires of their customers, be it round, 
juicy breasts, plump bottoms, or thick thighs. No matter the preference, a Missionary must explore 
every option to keep people satisfied.

Conversely, the Backdoor position requires an altogether different sort of person. On several 
occasions, Mr. Sanders has caught his chicken distributors trying to undercut the quality of his 
meats by sneaking a cock in the back door, and he's had enough. He needs vigilant employees working 
in the back to ensure only the finest meats are allowed to enter. He expects them to employ 
effective protection techniques to secure the company against bleeding profits and unsatisfied 
customers.

Lemoyne Fried Chicken is happy to embrace the hardest of workers and welcome them into their 
ever-broadening fold. A firm hand, quick tongue, and strong back will be needed to serve their 
customers well. Those who think they have the vigor to handle the constant flow of such an intricate 
business should apply for their favorite position today!
