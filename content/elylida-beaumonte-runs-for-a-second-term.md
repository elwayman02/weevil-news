As the only candidate campaigning for re-election, Elylida Beaumonte finds herself in a unique position. 
She is one of only two candidates with prior political experience and a track record that voters can 
evaluate before declaring their support. However, that track record can only tell so much. To 
understand Miss Beaumonte, one must understand where she came from prior to being a legislator.

Elylida got her start in New Alexandria working at the saloon in Valentine, where she spent much of her 
time. She had already served as a medic supporting the armed forces in the war, so she soon put those 
skills to good use in the local doctor's office. Being a doctor and ensuring the safety of saloon 
patrons allowed her to help a lot of people, but she saw an opportunity to do more.

At the time, people felt they couldn't speak to Governor Devine easily, but Miss Beaumonte knew 
differently. As one of the head doctors on the New Alexandria Medical Board, she had worked with him 
to eradicate cholera from Armadillo and McFarlane's Ranch, heading up the expedition to those 
disease-stricken lands. She originally ran for state representative to help make people's voices 
heard, to give them a chance to be more connected to their government.

As an elected representative, Elylida drove forward a number of major accomplishments in her first 
term. She pushed the government hard to fund the construction of a well-lit doctor's office at Emerald 
Ranch, allowing the folks there to be more self-sufficient as they had quick access to medical 
supplies without having to ride to Valentine. She also assisted in writing H.R. 11, the Crimes 
Against Justice, Reformation Act (CAJRA), which increased the punishment for Obstruction of Justice 
charges while adding new lower-level charges to give deputies new tools to differentiate between 
individuals who were actively interfering with the law versus simply fleeing from them. 

Her greatest challenge in the first term was the writing of H.R. 1, which established the rules 
of order that allowed the legislature to pass further legislation, at a time when no such rules 
existed. Additionally, she felt that the focus on legislative process and the Wapiti Treaty 
held her back from being able to fulfill one of her campaign promises, though she did not elaborate. 

Elylida has a number of plans to continue her work in a second term. One priority is to organize 
government cleanup of the Emerald Ranch saloon, getting rid of spiderwebs and dirt as well as 
sponsoring the addition of new furniture. She also plans to push for the irrigation of new farmland 
in Emerald Ranch, Blackwater, and up north on native land. Having heard a lot of concern from 
constituents over the consequences of property theft, she plans to push for additional fines that 
force criminals to reimburse victims for lost property and horses.

Miss Beaumonte would like to bring her experience back to the state legislature for at least one more 
term. She feels that many candidates are making promises that aren't possible to fulfill, a 
mistake she also made in her first campaign. Since the state is guaranteed to have at least two 
inexperienced legislators elected, she hopes to coach them on how the job works and help them 
understand the role. If she serves three terms, Elylida is considering running for governor to 
continue her service to New Alexandria, leaving a legacy of a stable legislature behind.

Despite being very busy with election season, Miss Beaumonte still takes her duties as a representative 
seriously. She strives to be approachable, accessible, and willing to talk to anyone regardless of 
their past, present, or future as a civilian, criminal, or state employee. She never turns people 
down when they make a suggestion, taking their ideas and seeking more perspectives to determine 
whether to push for immediate implementation or take the time to refine it further.

Elylida also constantly seeks to help people, baking biscuits for young children and needy folks 
around the state. With her background as a doctor, she believes everyone deserves to live, deserves 
a chance no matter what they do or who they are. She claims endorsements from fellow candidates 
Addison Flanagan, Ramona Ryder, Ada Lockwood, and Henry Clerk, business owner Frank Moses, and the 
New Alexandria Research Board, which she has personally funded to discover disease cures.

She's running to ensure the people's right to equal representation. She's running to be an accessible 
member of the state government, and her track record speaks for itself. Those who want to continue 
to build on the direction of the current government should consider a vote for Elylida Beaumonte. 
As she always says, "You give a little bit of respect, you earn a little bit of respect and vice versa."
