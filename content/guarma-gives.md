When someone mentions Guarma, one often thinks of the waves that crash back and forth against its 
sandy beaches. Other times, people think of the trees that touch the blue skies or the birds that 
fill the air with their songs. For Mortimer Rivers, founder of Weevil News, and Kristy Davis, a 
new-found member of Caduceus Cross, Guarma was much more. In this article, Dr. Kristy Davis shares 
her thoughts on the outing that Mr. Rivers took her on as well as her impressions of Guarma:

Hailing from Bergen, Norway, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Where I’m from, we had plenty of beaches 
and places to walk along the shore. But we didn’t have many trees, most of those were burnt down 
from the fires started by war and hatred. So when we came to Guarma, it was like I was looking at a 
home I haven’t seen in so long; it was a home I missed. Seeing the pure blue ocean made me remember 
simpler days when kids would run into the cold waves laughing. Of course, I couldn’t resist but to 
drag Mortimer with me into the cold blue, I’m sure one of us will get a cold but luckily… I’m a doctor.

After we walked by the shore, we visited the small castle-like structure that overlooks Guarma. 
Weathered by age and storms, the castle still was magnificent even with its cracks and strewn bricks. 
It was as if I was some kind of princess and Mr. Rivers was meant to be my prince that would make 
me a queen. I’m sure he is some kind of prince, he definitely looked like one. He was dressed so 
fancy that I didn’t recognize him at first but I quite liked what he wore… it was different. It was 
for me.

Guarma gave so much more to me than its sandy beaches and tall trees that pepper it with natural 
beauty. Gaurma gave me a memory that I won’t soon forget, at least not anytime soon. Mr. Rivers 
showed me the beauty that Guarma had to offer and what it could mean to us, especially me. It was a 
piece of home that I needed, especially after everything that had happened. At the end of our date 
we visited a waterfall and shared food and chocolate- which was absolutely amazing. My family used 
to manufacture chocolate in Norway long before I decided to become a doctor. It was nice to feel 
like my parents were there with me for once, after all this time.

I can’t thank Mr. Rivers enough for the time we had and I can’t recommend Guarma enough to any 
couple wanting a unique outing. Guarma has beautiful sites that I haven’t seen or explored yet 
but I’m sure each one is more beautiful than the last. With crisp air and fresh views, Guarma is 
the place to go because it gives so much more.
