Blackwater is experiencing a revival. The once-thriving port town has been stagnant in recent years, 
construction seemingly stalled indefinitely as nearby Valentine and Armadillo became local hubs. 
All that's about to change, however, with the grand opening of The Black Dog Saloon!

Co-owned by Mason Black and Moondance, the saloon opened this week to great fanfare. A 
family-friendly joint in the center of Blackwater, The Black Dog also caters to the pet-loving 
crowd. They carry treats for cats and dogs to share with your furry friends, and custom smoke 
products like cigarettes, cigars, and pipe tabacco to share with your non-furry ones.

They're focused on supporting the local community, bringing plenty of Guarma rum up from the docks 
to revive the port business. The proprietors have also promised that a portion of all profits 
from the saloon will go to the native tribes of the land, demonstrating that they open this 
business with respect for all peoples in and around Blackwater.

The Black Dog comes with all sorts of amenities, including a bath and room for rent upstairs. The 
upper floor also holds a fine blackjack table, giving tale to many great events to come. They 
are working on a number of ideas to bring the community together, including inviting political 
figures to come down and speak to the people of Blackwater.

The Black Dog Saloon is currently hiring for a number of positions, including an accountant, barkeepers, 
musicians, security, and card dealers. They're also looking for an artist to design posters 
to advertise their business. It's clear that Mr. Black and Moondance have big plans to make 
this saloon a staple of the revived Blackwater economy. Make sure to stop in enjoy their fine 
hospitality any time you're heading through the Great Plains!
