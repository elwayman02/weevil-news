Have you felt the calling to bring news to the citizens of New Alexandria? Do you desire to be part 
of the wave of truth sweeping the state? If so, Weevil News wants you to come on board and join our 
team! We're searching for talented writers and gifted salespersons to aid us in our mission to be 
read by all those who seek to stay informed of the events of the state.

Our distributors are responsible for the sale of newspapers throughout the state. Each week, they 
retrieve a stack of the latest issue from our office in Valentine and spread across the land 
ensuring its availability to all who thrive on the latest news of the day. A good salesperson can 
entice the customer with hints of what an issue contains while not revealing the full nature of 
its contents. A gifted tongue and amicable personality will serve you well in this role, which can 
often be performed as a supplement to other ongoing work and activities. 

Conversely, the role of a writer is as much about the word you think as those you speak. Your job is 
to convey not just the facts, but the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from them. A good journalist 
is fair and ethical in their work but does not shy away from the truth insomuch as they are able to 
confirm it. Our job is not to keep the happiness of all, but rather to do justice to the facts we 
aim to represent to our readers.

As a writer, your wordsmithing is your primary skill, but your connections to the people are equally 
as important. For indeed, to have anything worthwhile to write about, you must endeavor to speak with 
people and hear the stories of their lives. You must forge a network with both individuals of stature 
and responsibility as well as those who live the noble purpose of daily survival in our fair state. 
Listen to the words they care to share, and endeavor to accurately portray the events of the day as 
they've been relayed.

Whether your talents lay with writing, sales, or otherwise, Weevil News has work for you! As our 
paper continues to grow, so too will our need for individuals to take up the mantle of ethical 
journalism. Please contact Mortimer Rivers in Valentine or by telegram to himself or "Weevil News" in 
order to inquire after our employment opportunities.
