Eli Mixon, proprietor of The Pint Of No Return in Valentine, has decided to turnover a new leaf in 
life. After running the saloon for quite some time, he's been encouraged by many friends and local 
business owners to seek appointment as the town mayor. With people rallying behind him and little 
well-known opposition as of yet, Eli intends to be the new face of Valentine moving forward.

Weevil News spoke with Mr. Mixon, who said he hadn't really thought too much about politics prior to 
the state election. Now, he wants to be a go-between for lawfolk, business owners, and civilians in 
the area, working to improve communications between all camps. Eli wants to repair relations between 
deputies and the folks of Valentine, being a middle man to smooth this over and restore trust while 
also making himself available to deputies as a resource.

In previous weeks, Eli has been primarily focused on the creation of a business association, bringing 
entrepreneurs together for the betterment of Valentine. Now he wants to continue his focus on 
prosperity, pushing for new businesses to open around town. In particular, he hopes to see people 
operating out of the law office next to the gunsmith, as well as adding more stands at the west end 
market.   

Valentine isn't the only thing Eli wants to change, however. He recognizes that he needs to strive 
for personal change to be a great mayor. He wants to kick his drinking habit and undergo hypnosis 
treatment for his hiccuping, aiming to transform into a more presentable leader for the Heartlands. 
Page two of his life will be focused on reform and brightening the spirits of folks around town. Eli 
Mixon is putting all his hopes and dreams into Valentine. As he always says, "It's a shithole, but 
it's our shithole. We're gonna make it the best shithole we can!"
