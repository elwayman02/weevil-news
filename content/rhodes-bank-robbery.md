The fine citizens of Rhodes had their peaceful town disrupted Saturday night as a violent 
gang descended on the local bank. Quick response from local law enforcement escalated the 
situation into a shootout, leaving many wounded in the area.

At this time, Weevil News has no information on the identity or whereabouts of the gang, 
though it is believed that they regularly operate in the area of Rhodes. Given the scale 
of both the violence and valuables taken, several bounty hunters are seeking those responsible 
in hopes of a large payday. Surviving law enforcement could not be reached for comment on this story.
