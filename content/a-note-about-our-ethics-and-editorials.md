It's become apparent that, in our fledgling days as a publication, many people here in New Alexandria 
are not yet accustomed to the new ethics of journalism that have developed in our industry. There is 
this pervasive idea that everything printed in a publication represents the position of the paper and 
its editor. We here at Weevil News would like to take a moment to clarify our stance on ethical 
journalism.

We believe that it is not the role of news outlets to keep everyone happy. If everyone is happy with 
all of the stories we print, we have not tried hard enough to uncover the truth. The truth rarely 
appeals to everyone, nor is it ever black or white. The world of gray in between is a world of 
disappointment, but in it lies enlightenment. Our job as journalists is to shed light on the facts as 
we can ascertain them, to the best of our abilities.

Furthermore, it is not the job of the news to remain completely unbiased. While there is rarely a 
clear answer to any situation, it also does a disservice to our readers to pretend as if there is 
always an equal middle ground. It is our job to duly draw reasonable conclusions from the facts we 
are able to obtain and report them as such. However, that does not mean that we start from a 
conclusion and only seek out the facts to support that conclusion, nor do we ignore facts that run 
contrary. We present *all* of the facts we can confirm and only then draw our conclusions. In that 
way, we best serve the interests of the people to be as fully informed as possible.

Finally, let us clarify our stance on editorials. There are many occasions in which a public figure 
or person of interest will approach our publication with a piece they have written representing 
their own thoughts on a topic or situation. It is not our job to concur with their position or 
represent it as our own. Rather, it is our job to decide if the letter is of public interest and to 
publish it for our readers. At times, we may even have our own coverage presenting a different 
viewpoint from the editorial. Regardless, our readers must know that an editorial represents only 
the opinion of its author and not that of Weevil News.

We at Weevil News feel our continued commitment to transparency and honest communication serves the 
best interests of our readership and the general public. We will further strengthen our efforts to 
seek out and represent the truth to the best of our abilities, and we welcome further conversations 
with engaged citizens about the role of journalism and ethics in our society. Most of all, we thank 
you, the citizens of New Alexandria, for your continued patronage and support of our mission!
