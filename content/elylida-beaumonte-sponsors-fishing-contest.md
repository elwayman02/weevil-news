This election season, head on up to Brandywine Drop for one of the premier fishing events of 
the summer. Sponsored by candidates Elylida Beaumonte, Addison Flanagan, and Ramona Ryder under the 
prestigious hosting of the New Alexandria Association of Gaming (NAAG), this contest is sure to be 
one humdinger of an event!

An exact date has yet to be announced, but you can be assured that posters will go up on the notice 
board as soon as it's been confirmed. Gather together in the northeast corner of the state on the 
day for a speed-fishing extravaganza. Held in District 3, each contestant will be given thirty 
minutes to catch as many fine specimen from the Kamassa River as they can. Fishing will commence 
across all four of the prime fishing spots around the Drop, giving everyone plenty of space to 
cast their rods.

All entry fees are covered thanks to the generosity of the Beaumonte campaign. However, please make 
sure to bring your own fishing rods before you head up to Brandywine Drop, as the organizers can't 
provide equipment for all possible comers. A fisher's rod is their best friend, and that can make 
all the difference between a huge catch and an empty bucket. Be prompt and ready to fish, and you 
could walk away with a huge cash prize for your efforts!
