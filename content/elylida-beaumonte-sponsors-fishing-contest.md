This Saturday, August 1st, head on up to Brandywine Drop for one of the premier fishing events of 
the summer. Sponsored by candidates Elylida Beaumonte, Addison Flanagan, and Ramona Ryder under the 
prestigious hosting of the New Alexandria Association of Gaming (NAAG), this contest is sure to be 
one humdinger of an event!

Gather together in the northeast corner of the state at 3 pm EST on the day for a speed-fishing 
extravaganza. Held in District 3, each contestant will be given thirty minutes to catch as many fine 
specimen from the Kamassa River as they can. Fishing will commence across all four of the prime 
fishing spots around the Drop, giving everyone plenty of space to cast their rods.

While entry is believed to be free, please make sure to bring your own fishing rods before you head 
up to Brandywine Drop as the organizers can't provide equipment for all possible comers. A fisher's 
rod is their best friend, and that can make all the difference between a huge catch and an empty 
bucket. Be prompt and ready to fish, and you could walk away with a huge cash prize for your trouble!
