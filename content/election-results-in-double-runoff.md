With 237 votes cast last weekend, the state election has been on the top of mind for many folks 
around New Alexandria for several weeks now. The hotly contested process featured strong campaigns 
from several candidates in both races. After dozens of campaign events, speeches, and letters to the 
public, the certified results finally came in on Monday.

The Governor's race came down to two strong contenders, Addison Flanagan and Winifred Lockheart. 
Running passionate, intense campaigns, they clearly captured the hearts and minds of the public. 
With 44% and 36% of the vote respectively, these two women captured a mammoth 80% share between them. 
Josiah Shepard posted a solid 10% in third place, with Cedric Worth taking 7% and the final 3% going 
to Jebediah Heyworth. Since no candidate got 50% of the vote, Miss Flanagan and Miss Winnie will face 
each other in a head to head runoff scheduled for this weekend.

That wasn't the only big news of the election, however! Henry Clerk captured a commanding 26% of the 
vote, with Ada "Dove" Lockwood taking home another 23% for herself. In a surprising result, both 
Elylida Beaumonte and Ramona Rider received exactly 103 votes for a 17% share each. This led 
the Attorney General Alexander Jefferson to give Governor Devine the tiebreaker through a coin flip 
that went the way of Miss Beaumonte among much uproar from attendees.

Witnesses report that Ramona Ryder gave a fiery, impassioned speech at the event, decrying the 
injustice of taking the result out of the hands of the people. While Elylida's response was notably 
far more muted in victory, she later released a statement apologizing for not standing up for the 
voice of the people after the Governor declared her the victor. A federal magistrate has since 
directed the Attorney General to void the results for the third seat, leading to a runoff between 
these two women in parallel with the final election for Governor.

The stage has been set for an epic rematch among these four amazing women in this weekend's runoff. 
Time will only tell who emerges victorious, and it's up to the people to make that decision. The 
election will resume Friday, August 14th at 8 pm EST, and polls will be open until the same time on 
Sunday. Make sure to head down to Saint Denis and cast your vote, it's time to make your voices 
heard, New Alexandria!
