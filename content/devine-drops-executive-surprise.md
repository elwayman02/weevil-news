It appears that though New Alexandria thought it was done with Frank Devine, he was not done with 
them. The former Governor, known for delaying action on legislation passed by the state 
representatives, released a bevy of "Executive Orders" just hours before he left office. On the day 
that Governor Flanagan was inaugurated, she was greeted by six announcements that drastically changed 
the world she was set to govern.

The first order, E.O. 001, established a system for Executive Orders. Devine ordered the 
establishment of a legal framework by which the Governor can direct the government to take actions 
beyond the assigned scope of their abilities according to the state constitution. While these orders 
can be remanded by the Judiciary and are restricted from violating signed bills from the Legislature, 
they otherwise take immediate effect and appear to give the Governor near-unlimited authority. In 
fact, considering that state representatives require the Governor's signature to pass any and all 
legislation, it's unclear how they could even pass laws to override an Executive Order without the 
Governor's approval.

The second order, E.O. 002, provides sole authority to the United States Congress to appoint 
successors to elected state positions or call for an emergency elected should any seat be vacated 
through death, resignation, or other circumstances. This order appears to take the governing of the 
state out of the hands of the people, as they would be at the mercy of Congress to appoint their 
own officials until the next scheduled election. It's unclear if the current or former state 
representatives were consulted regarding this change, or if any alternatives were considered.

The third order, E.O. 003, directs the long-awaited establishment of a "Bounty Hunting 
Certification". While vigilantism remains illegal, deputies can now issue a "Wanted Bounty" if 
approved by a judge. These bounties will allow licensed bounty hunters to pursue the targets for 
capture and transport to law enforcement. This is expected to particularly have an impact on New 
Austin, long-considered lawless territory where deputies cannot enter in pursuit of their duties 
without a group of six officers. Bounty hunters will be able to work alone or with others in their 
efforts to bring wanted individuals before the justice system.

The fourth order, E.O. 004, establishes most of Big Valley as "Devine State Park". This area, 
encompassing the Mount Shann and its foothills as long as the western forest down to Owanjila, 
is bounded by Strawberry to the south, Monto's Rest to the east, and Little Creek River to the north. 
While current residents and structures are not to be removed, the state park bars new developments, 
mining industry, logging, and hunting for trophy or profit within the boundaries of the park. This 
order appears to have been issued without consultation of the natives living in Big Valley, 
according to our sources, though Weevil News has been unable to reach them for comment at this time.

The fifth order, E.O. 005, designates many properties as "government buildings" owned by the state. 
In addition to sheriff departments, police stations, and Sisika Penitentiary, three estates have been 
official declared as "state property". The first of which is Braithwaite Manor, which is to be 
deemed the "State Marshal's Estate". The second is the Governor's residence on the northwest corner 
of Saint Denis. The third location is that of the Mallory Memorial Library and Archives, which have 
been seized at the order of Governor Devine to be the "State House". It is unclear if the residents 
of Braithwaite Manor were given the opportunity to weigh in on this decision or retrieve their 
belongings before the order was issued.

In speaking with head librarian Thomas Foster, Weevil News learned that he was not consulted prior 
to the announcement, which was issued while the Library's benefactor Winifred Lockheart was curiously 
missing. As we previously reported, Devine himself had made lethal threats against Miss Winnie, 
pointing a gun at her head when she objected to his attempts to extra-judicially execute an individual 
outside his authority as Governor. It's unclear if the state government will allow the seized books 
to be recovered from the library or if the state legislature will pursue an act to amend the results 
of this order.

The sixth and final order issued by former Governor Devine, E.O. 006, sidestepped the campaign 
promises of the incoming elected officials to establish "criminal justice reforms". Specifically, 
it was order that all fines associated with felonies shall be revoked and rescinded permanently. 
While misdemeanors will continue to have fines, felonies will only include prison time moving forward. 
Any outstanding fines in excess of *TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS* have been reduced to that amount, as well. 
While there are many within the state who rejoice at this change, it's likely the deputies themselves 
feel betrayed by the order. Weevil News has been told that deputies keep half of all fines paid as 
part of their income, so this will result in a substantial monetary loss for law enforcement who 
make a point of collecting fines owed.

It remains to be seen how the state government and its citizens will react to these last-minute orders, 
but one thing is clear. New Alexandria has been forever changed, and the landscape of our society 
altered. Only time will tell whether these orders will bring about positive or negative change, and 
we must trust in our new Governor and State Representatives to act accordingly in our best interests.
