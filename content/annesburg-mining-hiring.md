Are you weak of mind but strong of body? Annesburg Mining Company wants you! 
The coastal town is currently experiencing a mining boom that can only be described 
as "explosive". With operations currently in full swing, the mine is in desperate need 
of workers to continue expansion.

Workers need only be willing to work long shifts swinging a pickaxe in the tunnels 
west of Annesburg. Simply fill up a mine cart with ore and load it in one of the wagons 
waiting outside, then drive the wagon down to Van Horn Trading Post, where it will be loaded 
onto boats to be taken down the river and sold in Saint Denis and Blackwater. Each trip 
pays a grand *NINE DOLLARS*, giving hard workers plenty of money to spend at the local 
saloon.

Contact the foreman inside the mine to inquire about employment. Annesburg Mining Company is 
currently accepting temp workers, so ride out east and make your fortune!
