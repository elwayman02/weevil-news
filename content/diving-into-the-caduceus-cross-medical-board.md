Dr. Hope Pisces, formerly part of the New Alexandria Medical Board, had become disillusioned with her 
involvement in that organization. She felt that her continued membership was upholding a legacy she 
disagreed with, so she left and started her own business, Caduceus Cross. This new medical board 
gave her the opportunity to continue working and pursue her own desires for the medical field.

She formed Caduceus Cross to train people and expand their knowledge of medical treatments. A lot of 
people panic when someone is hurt, and she wanted more folks to be able to act quickly and decisively 
to save lives in an emergency. Hope also established a system of consistent uniforms for 
professionals working under her purview, in an attempt to make them more readily identifiable and 
reduce the time it takes to identify a doctor or medic when one is needed. These uniforms have been 
a major help so far, serving a similar purpose to how deputies are identified by their white hats. 

Unlike the deputies, however, Dr. Pisces made sure their trainees had a respectable outfit to wear. 
She feels that it's not helpful to embarrass trainees or make it look like their work is a joke. 
If people are laughing at them, it's difficult to do their jobs effectively. Even trainees deserve 
respect, and she wants their uniforms to let people know that these are people who citizens can go 
to when they need help. 

One of her biggest accomplishments so far has been the establishment of a pricing system for 
medical care. While she and others will always provide treatment to those who need it, she desired to 
be financially independent and for doctors to receive recompense for the important services they 
provide. Just because doctors are working out of goodwill to help people, it's still a career; 
they deserve to be able to put food on the table for themselves and their families.

While it's been frequently discussed, the government has yet to provide legislation to pay doctors 
like they do other essential services such as law enforcement. Thus, Dr. Pisces took initiative to 
solve the problem herself. They now have a system that assigns a cost to different services, hoping 
people will understand the consequences of getting injured as it pertains to medical expertise and 
supplies. They plan to track individual debts and will use the legal system as appropriate if bills 
are not paid in a timely manner. However, they still try to be understanding of people's financial 
situations and will work with them to make reasonable accommodations.

Caduceus Cross has established seven main positions for members of its organization. As the Board 
President, Dr. Hope Pisces is the director of its operations, responsible for interviewing and 
determining probationary periods and training courses. She judges people's existing experience and 
places them appropriately for continued training to expand their medical knowledge according to their 
goals. She also undertakes consideration of all complaints and will take action if any ethical 
questions are raised.

As her deputy, Dr. Elylida Beaumonte serves as the Vice President of Caduceus Cross. She provides a 
second opinion in an advisory role to the Board President and acts in the same set of responsibility 
when she is absent. As leaders of the organization, they both also serve as Doctors. All Doctors 
can diagnose illness, train in surgical methods, provide patient consultations, and prescribe 
medications. They also often specialize in fields such as medicine, psychology, or toxicology.

The emergency responders of the medical board are the Field Medics. These professionals know how to 
dress bullet wounds, consult and prescribe drugs, and provide front-line trauma care. They are the 
experts in emergency medicine. Registered Nurses, on the other hand, act as low-grade doctors. They 
provide diagnoses, consultations, and prescriptions on top of emergency trauma care. They're the 
all-around generalists of Caduceus Cross.

Not to be confused with a Registered Nurse, the Nurse specializes in active care of patients. They 
are responsible for cleaning, dressing, and providing nursing care to individuals in recovery and 
active treatment. They are trained in first aid and ongoing care techniques such as providing saline 
to their patients. Last but not least, the Trainee position is where those without experience begin. 
Those under training for medical theory and qualifications will work alongside and shadow other 
members of the board, learning the ropes until they graduate to another position.

The board has been operating since it was licensed on July 25th, and it now has over *TWENTY* members. 
Three of the first four trainees became Registered Nurses within the first month, showing the success 
of the program so far. At the time of our interview, there were six Doctors (three probationary), 
three Registered Nurses, four Field Medics (one probationary), three Nurses, and five Trainees. 
Caduceus Cross works to bring like-minded people together and build a family. Joining the medical 
board is a way to get people off the streets and learn something that benefits society. They're 
here to save lives, save time, and get people to a medical professional faster!
