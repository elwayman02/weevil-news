Dr. Hope Pisces and Dr. Elylida Beaumonte have formed a new medical board named Caduceus Cross. They 
aim to help spread medical knowledge throughout New Alexandria, focusing on sharing information over 
gaining employees for themselves. Even those who don't aim to become doctors themselves are welcome, 
as they just want to teach people how to keep others alive in case of an emergency. If you've got 
medical experience or want to be trained in the science of medicine, go see one of the Caduceus Cross 
board members to join their program!
