Residents of New Hanover, beware! A crazed cult has been abducting people (and even children!) 
from around the Valentine area. Calling themselves the "Church of Francis", this ominous group 
is looking to attack or kidnap those deemed weak or less fortunate under the guise of calling them 
"sinners".

In recent days, they have been involved in a number of heinous incidents. Weevil News has received 
reports of a drowned person they "baptized", a child who was burned alive with fire arrows, and 
more. In a particularly grevious act, one young boy was taking out of town and forced to run for 
his life. The cult members then chased him down with machetes and sliced him up without a care 
for life or limb.

To date, the Church of Fracis has had at least two shootouts with law enforcement and civilians. 
Lawmen deputized several civilians on Thursday and rode out to apprehend them, eventually bringing 
the lot to Sisika in chains. Unfortunately, they served their time and went straight back to their 
violent ways. An attempt to kidnap Senior Deputy Deerhorn was thankfully thwarted by nearby 
civilians, who sent them packing.

These "church members" are considered armed and extremely dangerous. They are known to dress in 
all black and call people "sinner" in creepy, raspy voices. If you see one of these folk, steer 
clear for your own safety and immediately inform a Deputy. They show no signs of stopping their 
acts of terror!
