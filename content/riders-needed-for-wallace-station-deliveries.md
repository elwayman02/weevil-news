A call for workers has gone out as business picks up at the west end market in Valentine. With 
chicken, fish, paninis (some sort of Italian flat sandwich), and even non-food items selling at a 
brisk clip daily, plenty of goods are moving in and out of the thriving camp area. Now, many 
of these businesses are expanding their operations by providing delivery of their products to 
workers at nearby train stations.

The first route they've set up takes riders west to Wallace Station, just across the Cumberland Falls 
this gorgeous landscape is known to be riddled with wolf packs, making it difficult for potential 
customers to make the trek down to Valentine themselves. Thus, intrepid delivery specialists are 
being hired to bring food and goods up to the station itself, braving the dangers themselves for a 
cut of the profit.

Those with a good, fast horse and a durable satchel should head down to the market to pick up work 
any day of the week. Simply speak to the dispatch woman behind the tent across from the stables, 
and she'll give you a package with their latest orders to fulfill. Ride on up to the station 
where you'll find the customer waiting for you out front, and they'll pay upon delivery. It's as 
simple as that!

With the ongoing growth of Valentine bringing even more successful businesses to the Heartlands, 
it's only a matter of time until more delivery routes open up for intrepid riders. Get in on the 
business now and establish yourself as one of their premier delivery folk, and you'll surely be 
rewarded for your efforts. Plus, never forget that those who aim to distinguish themselves as 
transportation professionals should consider joining the Riders Union for extra benefits and 
networking throughout the community!
