The formation of the new Riders Union was welcomed with much fanfare at its inaugural 
meeting in Valentine on Saturday. The union aims to represent all those in the 
transporation industry, from wagoneers and stagecoach drivers to horseback messengers 
and delivery folks. For a mere *TWO DOLLARS* a week, Union members gain an array of 
benefits including mutual protection, industry exposure, and access to 
potential employees and business partners.

Union co-founder Mortimer Rivers was selected as Chairman of the Union Board and will be 
handling public matters for the Union. He had this to say about the momentous occasion: 
"I am quite proud of this step forward in bolstering the success of Riders everywhere. It 
is time for us to stand up and organize our labor together, for the betterment of all!"

The Riders Union plans to recruit members in all districts and will eventually select a 
Union Boss to manage operations in each district as the organization expands. Inquire with 
Mortimer Rivers in Valentine for more information about joining the Union. The Riders Union 
is here to help, "Riding You To Success!"
