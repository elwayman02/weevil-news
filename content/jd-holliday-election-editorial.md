The following is an Editorial written by JD Holliday:

On Election Day, the results were tossed into turmoil as Ms. Ramona Ryder and Elylida Beaumonte were 
tied for votes running for state representative. The solution seemed simple. Allow a follow-on runoff 
against the two candidates. The governor's election was extended for another week. Why not allow the 
two candidates to continue campaigning and let the people decide?  Upon strict opposition from the 
people attending the event, the Election Committee, the Attorney General, and the current governor 
decided otherwise. Their solution was to flip a coin.

I am Joshua JD Holliday, the Executive Director (ED) of the New Alexandria Legal Advocates Society 
(NALAS), and former ED to the New Alexandria Bar Association. This editorial opinion does not reflect 
the views, thoughts, and decisions of the NALAS or the Bar. 

Upon hearing of the casual, cavalier methodology, and rationale used to select our esteemed state 
reps I decided to write this article to clear up misconceptions and misinterpretations of the New 
Alexandria Constitution. I'd also bring to attention the legal injustice that has plagued this 
great state. I now have a better understanding of why the election debacle came to be. 

Two nights ago I had the unfortunate pleasure of listening to the Governor pompously speak in the 
Valentine Saloon. He went on about his accomplishments as he took pleasure in boosting his incredible 
ego. As I ignored his political spin, one thing caught my attention and I quote, "If I had it in my 
hands, horse thievery or other minor crimes would equal death. The people of this state have it easy". 
It was at this moment, I realized that this mentality is the poison that trickles top down into our 
justice system that erodes the confidence that people have for our established institutions. 
Therefore, it is not surprising that this authoritarian figure who cons the people into a false 
sense of security would exercise his perceived authority to decide the fate of an election based on 
a coin flip.

These are the people that point guns at harmless citizens wearing masks and threaten to throw 
lawyers out of towns for trying to help people that are being questioned and detained. These 
are the people that deny you the right to pay your own bail because they feel like it, regardless 
of what the Constitution states. These are the people that will fail to tell you of your rights to 
a trial and convince you that your only recourse is to do the time and pay the fine. These are the 
people that will hit you with the butt of their shotgun while detained in a jail cell. These are the 
people that will fine you for violating so called “town ordinances” for not petting a dog. These are 
the people that will detain and arrest you for looking suspicious. Or arrest you for looking like 
someone else. Finally, these are the people that pervert Article II Section III of the Constitution 
for their own gain.  

* 1b "State Representatives shall be elected by the Citizen population at large."

* 2b. "Elections shall be a general pool of candidates, and the top three candidates in the election 
shall be appointed to each County by the Governor forthwith."

Based on 2b., the Attorney General would have you believe that the Governor has the right to PICK 
candidates in case of a tie. But what he fails to grasp is the Governor only has the right to 
appoint three candidates ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN ELECTED by the citizen population. What happens when 
there is four? Per the constitution there can only be three. Therefore, in order to be fully 
“elected by the people” logically, there has to be an election until a tie is broken. At which 
point, the Governor has the authority to appoint the three reps to their respective counties. 

2b. ONLY gives the Governor the right to appoint the elected officials into whatever county he wants 
them to serve in. Not pick in an elected tie and certainly not by coin flip. Furthermore, the 
rationale for using a coin toss was because the AG believes that extending the election would cost 
too much money and no one would be satisfied no matter which decision was made. Both are not good 
reasons for deciding the fate of the people.

I am disgusted by the current government and their attempt to underestimate the intelligence of the 
good people of New Alexandria. I hope that the new State Reps and the next elected Governess can 
clean up the executive branch and bring trust back into our institutions. Listen to the will of 
the people and not pervert the Constitution. Finally, treat citizens fairly and objectively within 
the law with an open heart. Regardless if they are native, criminals, or ordinary people trying to 
survive in a harsh land. Not carry on a mentality of punishing people by death for minor crimes.

Signed, JD Holliday
