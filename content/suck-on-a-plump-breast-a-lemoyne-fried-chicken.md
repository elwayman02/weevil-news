The good-natured Mr. Sanders, owner of Lemoyne Fried Chicken Company, only has one goal in mind: He 
wants to stuff his juicy breasts in your mouth! These, plump, succulent delights have been exposed as 
the company's most prominent feature. They truly stand out among the many tasty items you can sink your 
teeth into. Lemoyne Fried Chicken shines thanks to its secret blend of herbs and spices that give it a unique, 
flavorful burst in every bite.

Dipping them in a perfectly balanced milk and egg wash, Mr. Sanders carefully massages each breast to 
ensure they're filled with as much milk as possible. He then ensures each breast is artfully covered, 
keeping them from being too exposed to the air. Failing to do so causes the breasts to dry out and 
become overly stiff, to the point where they're unpleasant to suck on.

That's when each breast is flopped into the oil, lathering their curves until they shine like a 
glistening lake. Mr. Sanders keeps them in the oil just long enough to achieve a nice bronze color, 
indicating that the breasts have reached peak flavor. Customers will be licking their lips by the time 
they get their hands on a couple of Mr. Sanders' breasts!

Located across from the butcher in Valentine, Lemoyne Fried Chicken Company has a constant stream of 
customers lining up to suckle on their fresh breasts. For only $5, you can order them in crispy or 
extra crispy, the premium option for the true breast connoisseur. You won't have experienced true 
pleasure until you wrap your lips around Mr. Sanders' plump, juicy breasts!
