Addison Flanagan has run a whirlwind of a campaign. In fact, she proudly proclaimed that fact this 
week, posting the calendar of her campaign events spanning every single day of the election season, 
often with multiple occurring in a single day whether or not Miss Flanagan planned to personally 
attend and meet potential voters at her own events. Now, while one cannot begrudge someone for 
running an intense, high-profile campaign, an incident of more concern took place before the polls 
opened.

On Thursday, July 30th, Miss Flanagan announced several showings of the motion picture show 
"Distressed In The West" by Paradigm Pictures. Two of these showings were scheduled for Sunday, 
August 2nd, according to a poster the Weevil News team gathered off the notice board. The second 
of these events was planned to take place at 9 pm EST in District 4, and therein laid the problem. 

You see, something else was scheduled in District 4 on that evening. At 8:30 pm EST, Judge Tully 
planned to hear criminal charges being brought against an individual named Mister Happy by Senior 
Deputy James Walter and Attorney General Alexander Jefferson. This case was scheduled by the 
honorable Justice on Monday, July 27th, a full *THREE DAYS* prior to the campaign event announcement 
by Miss Flanagan.

As a result of these conflicting schedules, supporters of the Flanagan campaign swarmed to District 4 
on August 2nd, overloading local train capacity prior to the event and preventing those involved 
in the court case from arriving on time. This causes a *TWO AND A HALF HOUR DELAY* in the proceedings 
for State v. Mister Happy, reportedly leaving Judge Tully furious. Rumor has it that they may even 
be considering levying Obstruction of Justice charges against Miss Flanagan after the election 
concludes.

As a duly elected State Representative, one would think that Addison Flanagan understands and 
respects the judicial process and the rights of citizens to have their charges heard in a court of 
law. So why, then, would she choose to schedule a campaign event on top of a court case, much less 
one where the Attorney General was bringing criminal charges? She cannot claim ignorance; she 
announced the event personally, and it was the only case on the docket that week. So, we are left to 
wonder - does Addison Flanagan value her political ambitions above due process of the law?
