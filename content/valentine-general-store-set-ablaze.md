A local man set fire to the Valentine General Store on Saturday Afternoon. After several 
run-ins with passerby that had to be broken up by the law, the seemingly drunk man wandered into the 
General Store while those nearby attempted to calm him down.

As the law approached to keep the man calm, he yelled at them to stay back and began throwing 
fire bottles at the windows from inside the building. The front entrance of the General Store 
quickly caught fire, spreading to the front porch and the support beams for the balcony above. 

Law enforcement surrounded the building and managed to apprehend the man as he tried to sneak 
out the back of the building during the confusion caused by the fire. Unfortunately, no bystanders 
were able to find water fast enough to put out the fire as it spread across the entire front of the 
building. Luckily, a storm rolled into Valentine minutes later, putting out the fire before it 
consumed the entire building.

The General Store has remained open for now, but it is surely in need of extensive repairs after 
this incident. We hope that the community will come together in these tough times to help rebuild 
our beloved store that provide us with so many needed goods and provisions!
