Deputies are on the lookout for a man named Russell after reports of multiple 
shootings by this "religious" zealot. At least three victims are known at this 
time, each targeted to receive "judgment" for their apparent sins.

Weevil News has learned that Russell sought to ensure his victims survived their wounds, 
even going so far as to send deputies telegrams to inform them of where his victims 
were located. However, he is still armed and dangerous and has no qualms about hogtying 
his victims to take them off into the wilderness.

He was reported as wearing clothing similar to that of a preacher, but solid gray 
in color and covered by an overcoat to match. His outfit may also have a splash of blue 
to break of the gray. Russell has made it known that he intends to strike again, 
so please be wary of any individuals matching this description.

Deputies are searching for this man and will surely reward any and all information 
leading to his capture. Those who have seen Russell or received his "judgment" 
should contact Weevil News in Valentine as we continue to follow this story.
