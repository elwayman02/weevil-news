The storied New Alexandria Horse Racing Association recently announced their 
upcoming races for this week of July 19th. Headed by President Eddie Collins, 
the NAHRA has a long history of stellar racing events, including such standouts 
as the Strawberry 500, the Van Horn 400, and most recently the Flat Iron Lake 500. 

Speaking with Vice President Thatcher Ford, Weevil News learned of two new events 
scheduled for the upcoming week. The first event will be the Annesburg 400, featuring 
a massive prize pool of $400 for first, $200 for second, and $100 for third place. 
This exciting new race will take place on Wednesday, July 22nd at 10 pm EST in District 4.

Mr. Ford also informed us that a second race is in the works for this coming 
Saturday, July 25th. While the time and location are yet to be announced, racers 
should mark their calendars and keep an eye on the notice boards for further information.

These two events are sure to be must-see events this week! Bring your binoculars, 
a picnic basket, and a little money to gamble with; you'll have a fantastic time. 
The NAHRA is proudly sponsored by Ford & Sons, helmed by President and Chief of Security 
Thatcher Ford.
