The forests around Strawberry are known for their quality lumber, especially in the area east of town 
known as Monto's Rest. The serene slopes of Mount Shann ring with buzz of saws and the clang of axes;
the lumberyard there has cleared a vast swath of trees already. To support the ongoing construction 
boom throughout the state, the foreman there has sent out a call for workers to help process the 
lumber as production continues to accelerate.

Ride on up to the clearing and speak with the foreman to be provisioned your equipment, a freshly 
sharpened and gleaming ax. You'll be asked to grab the logs leftover from cutting up the various tree 
trunks, as they tend to pile up and clog the thoroughfare through the camp. In order to keep the 
operation running at peak efficiency, they need folks to clear these piles as quickly as possible.

Take your ax to the log pile quickly and put your back into it, chopping them into easily-transported 
firewood. While the foreman can't offer much in the way of pay, he'll happily let you take any 
and all wood you've chopped, as much as you can carry. The faster and harder you work, the more 
wood you can take with you.

In addition to being useful for campfires, cooking, and other daily pursuits, fine lumber like that 
found at Monto's Rest fetches a nice price at any general store. So, pick up an ax and help contribute 
to the local economy while earning a pretty penny for yourself at the same time!
