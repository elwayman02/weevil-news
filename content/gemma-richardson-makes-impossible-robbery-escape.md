This week, Gemma Richardson decided to rob the Valentine General Store. Burdened by numerous debts 
and fines, this young woman was desperate to raise some cash to pay them off. So, she walked into the 
General Store one day and asked, kindly but firmly, for the cashier to hand over everything in the 
register. Unfortunately, as she was discussing the finer monetary details with the man, five deputies 
approached the building.

As the lawfolk began taking positions outside, she managed to talk two of them into heading off to 
take care of some other important matters. With three left on the scene, two took up positions 
flanking the front door while the third swept around to the back. They opened a dialogue with Miss 
Richardson, attempting to convince her to walk out the front door and give herself up.

As onlookers gazed from across the street, the deputies learned of Gemma's financial woes and tried to 
leverage that to resolve the situation. One deputy offered her *TEN DOLLARS* if she turned herself in 
without fleeing, and another doubled that amount. However, that wasn't enough to convince this robber 
from abandoning her plans, at least until the unthinkable happened.

A distant whinny and the sound of hooves caused Gemma to peer out the back window at the fleeing ass 
of her getaway horse, ruining her entire escape plan. Picking up on her distress, the deputies 
redoubled their negotiation efforts. As they droned on and on at her, however, Miss Richardson saw an 
opportunity.

Striding brazenly out the front door, she caught the deputies flat-footed mid-sentence. Stunned for a 
moment, they could only watch as their target fled across the street, jumping atop a horse hitched at 
the corner of the hotel. One of the deputies managed to dash across after her, barely missing the 
chance to pull her from horseback. As she turned west toward the open field, they attempted to 
commandeer a horse for pursuit.

Unfortunately, the owner of the horse loudly objected to losing possession of their steed, and the 
deputies were forced to watch a frantic flight toward the western gorge with no method of pursuit. 
At this time it is unknown if Gemma Richardson was ultimately captured by the deputies, but one thing 
is clear: this will go down as one of the most improbable escapes pulled off in recent weeks!
