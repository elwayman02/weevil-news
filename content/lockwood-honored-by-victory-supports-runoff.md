Weevil News had the pleasure of speaking with Representative-Elect Ada Lockwood after election 
results were certified. Speaking on her victory, she said it was an absolute honor that people put 
their faith in her, something she doesn't take lightly. She felt that speaking to her future 
constituents face to face is what made her grassroots campaign successful, with supporters saying 
they voted for her because she "took the time to listen". She's still getting used to the idea that 
she won, but Ada feels like she and fellow Representative-Elect Henry Clerk hit the ground 
running with a great start on Monday.

After the results were announced, an emergency legislative session was called to draft H.R. 14, 
"A bill to address and resolve ties in State Elections." Mr. Clerk and Miss Lockwood decided it was 
in the best interest of the people for them to be there and help with the drafting of the bill as 
incoming legislators. People present at the ceremony were clearly upset at how things had progressed, 
and that made it very clear something wasn't right about the process. Regardless of how sister 
states may have done things in the past, New Alexandria is its own state and the people were clear 
how they felt.

With Clint Masterson taking lead writing the bill, he called up the newly elected representatives and 
ran the wording by them so they could pitch in where necessary. Miss Lockwood said it was good to see 
what the process is like, even before assuming office. During the transition period in the next few 
weeks, the incoming legislators will be working with their outgoing peers to learn, observe and 
prepare for what comes next as the new legislative session kicks off.

Ada's first priority in office will be to focus on getting people the right to legal counsel in a 
wider variety of situations, so they're treated fairly throughout the process. She believes it's 
important for a third-party to be present during interactions with law enforcement to ensure an 
impartial witness to any events that take place while an individual in custody. Miss Lockwood 
believes there are many noble, hard-working deputies and vicious criminals in the state, but 
everyone deserves their day in court and many folks are in fact innocent. Having lawyers present 
will keep the justice system fair and honest, she says, and a little bit of oversight will provide 
immediate relief while they work on judicial reform for the long-term.

In working with the other legislators, Miss Lockwood is keen to follow the lead of those who have 
experience in other areas of interest, playing a support role in drawing up bills. In particular, 
though, she is looking forward to taking up bills to help those in the medical field, and she'd 
love to talk to primary and newly-trained doctors in the state to learn more about their needs 
and topics like mental health or salaries.

As the second highest vote getter in the election, Ada was absolutely thrilled to see Henry Clerk 
take the top spot, saying "If there was anyone I was hoping would make it into the legislature, 
it was Mr. Clerk." She spoke to his incredible skill with words as an author and praised the 
"solid head on his shoulders". She felt inspired by the phenomenal work he's done filling Blackwater 
with business and lively folk, and she said his election victory was thrilling and hard-earned!

Speaking on the upcoming runoff elections, Representative-Elect Lockwood doesn't feel that any of 
the remaining candidates would result in the state being in bad hands. While there are often 
candidates in an election who might be a bad fit for office, that's not the case with these four. 
Each has their strong qualities, she says, mentioning that Flanagan is efficient, Lockheart is 
empathetic, Beaumonte has experience, and Ryder has passion and a solid background. With so many 
highly qualified candidates, she finds it difficult to choose one to support in the runoff and 
would be honored to work with them all.

However, Miss Lockwood did make a point to show support for candidates that may not have as many 
of their good qualities being looked at by voters. For example, she feels that many people only 
see Winifred Lockheart's past and not the woman herself. Ada Lockwood supports Miss Winnie's 
campaign because her future and present matter more than her past. She believes that every person 
has a right to redemption and the chance to turn away from a life that may not have been ideal. 
They should be allowed to forge their own future, even as an elected member of government. Thus, 
Winifred Lockheart has Miss Lockwood's support in the sense that people are a little blinded by 
her past, and she has had the misfortune of being attacked over it, an action the 
representative-elect described as "cruel".

Ultimately, however, Ada Lockwood doesn't feel the runoff results are hers to call. She's more 
interested in seeing who the general public is rooting for at the end of the day, and that will 
determine who joins her in the New Alexandria government. Beyond that, she is ready to get to work.
Just because she's not campaigning doesn't mean she doesn't want people to bring her their 
concerns and ideas, so they should approach her wherever possible. It's now more important than 
ever to hear from the people and stay on the right path, doinog what's necessary in a timely 
manner. This representative-elect is prepared to do just that!
