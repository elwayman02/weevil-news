Winifred Lockheart, benefactor of the Mallory Memorial Library and former Gubernatorial candidate, 
has been found alive and well. Having been missing since the day the election results were announced, 
many in New Alexandria were worried for her safety as the days stretched on. Her friends had begun 
searching for her and trying to get in contact, but no one had been able to ascertain what had 
befallen Miss Winnie. That is, until this Tuesday, when she was finally discovered in Guarma.

Weevil News has decided to withhold the majority of the details from publication for the privacy of 
Miss Lockheart, but we can share that she had sustained several grievous injuries and was severely 
malnourished when found. Thankfully, her friends were able to transport her back to Blackwater for 
emergency treatment, and a team of skilled doctors took her to Saint Denis for further evaluation. 
At this time, she is resting under observation as she recovers from her injuries.

Weevil News is elated to hear of Miss Winnie's recovery. We hope to learn more about the circumstances 
surrounding her injury and disappearance in the coming weeks and will share what we can as information 
becomes available. If you have any insight into what happened, please reach out to our publication as 
soon as possible. For now, we wish Winifred Lockheart the best in her recovery and look forward to 
seeing her around New Alexandria once again.
