The New Alexandria Horse Racing Association brought us another wonderful event this Saturday in the 
Rhodes 400. Held at the storied Caliga Hall, this seven lap race ran counterclockwise around the western 
tobacco field, creating a rectangular track with two long straightaways, quite different from the tight 
twists and turns of other locations. A prize pool of *SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS* was up for grabs, with four 
hundred going to the ultimate winner.

The qualifying laps promised an exciting race, with Thatcher Ford posting an impressive time while the 
other races all clumped within a second of each other. However, organizer Eddie Collins ruled that, 
as an experience racer and Vice President of the NAHRA, Mr. Ford must start the race in last place. 
As the fog cleared and sunrise beamed over the fields, the horses lined up in the following order: 

Thaddeus LeBlanc (Charlie), Shawn McCree (Ranger), John Wyos (Horse With No Name 2), Georgia Banks 
(Rebel), Kevin Banks (Opie), Ryan Hastings (Moxxi), and Thatcher Ford (Blue) bringing up the rear. 
The stage was set for an exciting race at the only track that has ever had two races to date.
Weevil News had the chance to speak with a few of the riders before the race, learning that this was 
the very first track Mr. Hastings and Moxxi ever raced on, the day they arrived in New Alexandria. 

Chatting with power couple Georgia and Kevin Banks, they said they do everything together, including 
entering their first-ever NAHRA event on this fine day. They felt Caliga Hall was a fair track, with 
Georgia calling out the open gate near the starting line as her biggest concern and Kevin noting 
that turn four was a wide corner that could present trouble for riders. Even though he was starting 
just behind her in lineup, Kevin was confident that he'd finish ahead of her and be featured in the 
winner's circle by the end.

The race had a startling beginning as Thatcher Ford managed to surge from last place into the lead 
in just half a lap. Georgia Banks was close behind him in second, but the gap widened as the laps 
went on, with John Wyos falling to the back of the pack, right behind Ryan Hastings. By the time 
the last lap started, Thatcher had a commanding two turn lead over the others. With his victory 
inevitable, all eyes turned to the jockeying for second place.

Coming down the back stretch, Rebel began to flag, letting Shawn McCree move past her. Her slump 
worsened as John Wyos and Ryan Hastings suddenly surged from the back around turn three in a 
sudden burst of speed. Mr. Wyos gained incredible speed, closing the gap with Mr. McCree and passing 
him at the last second to take the second prize. As the others crossed the finish line, onlookers 
were treated to one final spectacle; Kevin Banks was bucked by Opie as he came down the final stretch, 
apparently dissatisfied with being pushed so hard in the race. Mr. Banks was forced to finish on foot, 
a move that would have disqualified him had he not already been in last place.

The final results were as follows: Thatcher Ford (Winner), John Wyos (Second), Shawn McCree (Third), 
Ryan Hastings, Georgia Banks, Thaddeus LeBlanc, Kevin Banks. As we caught up with Mr. Ford after the 
race, he seemed completely unsurprised by the result. He said he didn't feel too different about 
winning, as he never really loses unless he wants to. It's clear that Thatcher Ford and his Nokota 
steed Blue are on another level, making it obvious why he's a constant presence in the racing scene.
