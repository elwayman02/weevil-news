Many people think of their local gunsmith as just a counter with some guns behind it. That's not 
how Jericho Baker sees it, however. Along with his associates Silas Winchester and Wei Chao 
(together known as Winchester Arms Co), they aim to be the man *behind* the counter. Gunsmiths 
are more than just a place to buy new guns, and they're out to prove it!

Not only will Mr. Baker sell you new guns, he buys and sells used ones, too. In fact, he's so happy 
to take your old firearms off you that he'll pay willing folk to hold onto extra guns he can't 
carry himself. He'll also provide maintenance services for your weapons for just *FIVE DOLLARS*, 
but he's happy to teach you how to do it yourself. For only *TWO DOLLARS*, one can buy a cleaning 
kit, a nice wooden box with a latch on the front. The kit holds two rods (one for revolvers and 
another for rifles/repeaters), two brushes, oils, and everything else you need to keep your guns 
in working order.

Mr. Baker can usually be found at their Valentine location, with Mr. Winchester servicing Annesburg 
and Mr. Chao handling business in Rhodes. However, any of these men are happy to travel to any 
gun store to provide services; just send out a telegram and they'll be on their way. They hope to 
one day fill every gun store across the state with an expert gunsmith, so you can rest assured 
that quality service will be available anywhere you travel.

Winchester Arms Co has one more well-kept secret they don't want to be a secret anymore.
They want it to be known that all prices are negotiable. They welcome hagglers coming in their 
doors. Price aren't set in stone, and they find negotiations to be an interesting and exciting 
change of pace for their business. If the price ain't right, give 'em a fight!
