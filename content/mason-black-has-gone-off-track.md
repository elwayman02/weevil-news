Weevil News has learned of a nearly unbelievable series of events that took place over the last week. 
Mason Black, owner of The Black Dog Saloon in Blackwater, has apparently suffered a quick fall from 
grace after numerous conflicts that left those who knew him questioning his state of mind.

As far as our investigation can uncover, this all started with Mr. Black kidnapping a member of the 
Kray family, who came to Blackwater to confront him over the heinous act. In the ensuing discussion, 
Mason claimed that he "ran Blackwater", appearing to think that his business empire gave him control 
over any and all enterprise in the port town.

The Krays disagreed but turned to walk away peacefully at the end of the conversation. That's when 
Mr. Black shot them in the back, cowardly attempting to take the lives of individuals he had already 
wronged once before. He also sent a general telegram to the district declaring war on the entire Kray 
family, though the reason for this dispute is still unknown.

For his actions, Mr. Black was arrested and his business license revoked, rendering him unable to 
operate his newly-opened saloon. This prompted him to attack Deputy Milo Reines in a rage, as well as 
express extreme displeasure toward political ally Elylida Beaumonte, who cut ties after he went off 
the rails. Mason was heard claiming that she owed him *EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS*, an obscene amount of 
money that raises the specter of possible political favors that might have been in the works.

The violence didn't stop there, however. The restaurant and saloon in Rhodes was shot up multiple 
times as Mr. Black seemed to think the proprietor and employees there were closely associated with 
Miss Beaumonte. The fallout continued as more business partners walked away from the crazed man, 
including his close associate Moondance and nearly all of his security and saloon employees.

Mr. Black didn't take too kindly to folks wanting to stay clear of him, even going so far as to attack 
his former employees and their families. In one case he even shot their horse and left a note about 
"cutting ties", calling them a "traitor" as well. Weevil News has also heard rumors of Mr. Black 
shooting someone in the face down in Saint Denis, continuing his rampage across the state. It's 
unclear at this point what measures the State's Deputies are taking to reign in Mason Black, but thing 
is clear; he's absolutely done in Blackwater.
