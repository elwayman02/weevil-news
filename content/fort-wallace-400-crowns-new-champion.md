Expectations were high Wednesday night at the Fort Wallace 400, with history ready to be made no 
matter the outcome. Sponsored by the Winifred Lockheart campaign for Governor and Eli Mixon's 
mayoral campaign, NAHRA assembled a lineup of riders that had never won a race before. Even more 
impressive, they set a record with a double-digit field of ten for the first time, making the 
competition even more fierce.

Organizer Eddie Collins was happy to know that people wanna come out and compete in their events, 
noting that entry numbers continue to climb each week. This track was particularly interesting for 
such a race, being one of the largest ever. The average qualifying lap was upwards of 50 seconds, 
giving plenty of opportunity for the race to change as racers traversed the grounds. With complicated 
turns throughout the track, Thatcher Ford noted that it was one of the most difficult tracks they'd 
ever used.

The starting field was led by Representative-Elect Ada Lockwood (Smokey), followed by Patrick Cox 
(Duke), Georgia Banks (Rebel), and Kevin Banks (Opie) to round out the top four. The next section 
of the field included Eli Mixon (Stack), Sean McCree (Eastwood), Charli De La Croix (Red Fox), 
and gubernatorial candidate Winifred Lockheart (Revenge). Bringing up the rear were Charlene 
Eldridge (Browning) and Maria Spacito on a new, unknown horse.

Kevin Banks and Sean McCree hung back early in the race, with Mr. Banks making the first move to 
take the lead after several other racers ran into trouble at the turns. Eli Mixon, running his 
first race, had a tumble early, but he managed to work his way back up to the middle of the pack. 
Mr. McCree's conservation strategy let to him being lapped as Opie continued to surge, but he 
managed to get back on the main lap later in the race.

By the final laps, Kevin Banks had a huge lead, lapping Miss Eldridge around the final turn and 
nearly catching Miss De La Croix as he crossed the finish line in first place. Mr. Cox and 
Miss Lockwood finished in the money as well, with the following results for the rest of the pack: 
Winifred Lockheart, Maria Spacito, Eli Mixon, Georgia Bank, Sean McCree, Charli De La Croix, and 
Charlene Eldridge. While most of the riders were spread out as they finished the long race, 
Mr. Mixon was actually a close sixth behind Miss Spacito across the finish line.

The night's victory by Kevin Banks marked his second money finish in a row, after joining Thatcher 
Ford in a historic one-two shire placement at the Braithwaite 400. His rough last place finish in 
his first event gave him good 2.51:1 odds in the Fort Wallace 400, but there were no winning bets 
on the day. It's likely that Mr. Banks will come in under 2:1 for future races now that he's put 
up back to back impressive performances.

Speaking to him after the race, our winner felt really good about his performance. Before the NAHRA 
started hosting races, everyone made fun of Opie, he said, asking when he would get rid of the 
"big, fat, and slow" horse or put him down. When he heard about the races and decided to give them 
a shot, he wanted to give his horse a chance to prove himself. After a little trial and error in the 
first race (mostly error), he really dialed in his relationship with Opie.

After a couple practice runs on the Fort Wallace track, Mr. Banks felt he really got a feel for the 
troublesome corners. He noted plenty of obstacles to watch out for, including dangerous locals, wagon 
traffic, and the possibility of roaming wolf packs which thankfully didn't appear. The main problem 
other riders had in the race was cutting corners the right way, which is how he managed to pass a 
several people early on. Once he got in the lead, Kevin never looked back, just listening to Eddie 
and focusing on the laps. When he saw he was close to lapping someone near the end, he finally 
thought "Oh shit, I might have this" and pushed for the victory.

Mr. Banks is glad that he's been taking part in the races because it taught him how to conserve his 
horse while riding and gave him a better feel for Opie's rhythms. He's setting his next sights on 
NAHRA Vice President Thatcher Ford, who won the first two races he participated in. He'd then love to 
surpass three-time victor Josiah Shepard and his horse Godspeed, who is currently recovering from an 
injury. Kevin Banks plans to build on his success and become the first four-time winner in the 
history of New Alexandria.

After history was made yet again this week at the Fort Wallace 400, excitement continues to build 
for the next race hosted by the New Alexandria Horse Racing Association. Racing fans should take note 
of the upcoming Wapiti 400, arranged in cooperation with Chief Deerhorn and the Wapiti tribe. This 
event will again be sponsored by the Governor campaign of Winifred Lockheart as well as Valentine 
mayoral candidate Eli Mixon. It's sure to be another heart-racing intense outing, so be sure not to 
miss it!
