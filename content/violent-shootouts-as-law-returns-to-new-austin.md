Recent reports suggest that, despite the governor's declaration of New Austin as a "lawless territory", 
the deputies of New Alexandria do not intend to heed his advice to stay away. Weevil News has heard 
tale of numerous clashes between law enforcement and folk living in the formerly cholera-stricken town 
of Armadillo.

The saloon there is known as "Outlaw's Rest", a haven for those who are not necessarily criminals but 
seek respite from a law they don't believe in. The name predates the recent decision by our state 
legislature to lawfully define the term "outlaw" to apply to individuals who have evaded arrest 
under public bounty for more than 72 hours. While criminals have been known to brazenly frequent 
establishments throughout New Alexandria, this name alone does not indicate that those within are, 
in fact, wanted for alleged crimes.

Regardless, however, it seems that multiple shootouts have taken place in this local watering hole as 
law enforcement descended upon the quiet town. Sources say that the first incident left six deputies 
bleeding as they fled on horseback, having exchanged heavy fire with civilians inside the saloon. 
Another shootout took the life of the infamous "Pirate Queen" Anne Bonny who happened to have ridden 
to Armadillo at the time. It seems that every visit the deputies make to this supposed "lawless 
territory" ends in a shootout with civilians and lawfolk alike sustaining grievous injuries.

Further reports state that deputies have been making additional forays into the western part of our 
state to make minor arrests. While this is a well-known exception to the Governor's prior declaration, 
it certainly seems as if there has been an uptick in the enforcement of laws down there of late. It 
appears that the lawlessness of New Austin may be coming soon to an end, whether you like it or not.
