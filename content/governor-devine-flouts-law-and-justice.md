Weevil News has learned of shocking actions recently taken by Governor Frank Devine. Last Wednesday, 
he took the law into his own hands and flouted the responsibility of deputies as well as the rights of 
his own citizens. To set the scene, however, we'll have to explain the events leading up to this 
incident.

Laughing Eagle, one of the now-disbanded Comanche tribe, decided to rob the Valentine General Store 
that afternoon. As a one-time acquaintance of his, gubernatorial candidate Winifred Lockheart 
attempted to talk him down and convince him to give himself up to the deputies. Unfortunately, he 
decided to make a run for it and was subsequently apprehended, being taken to the local jail.

The deputies allowed Miss Winnie to enter the jail to speak with Laughing Eagle so she could explain 
what had happened to cause his tribe to disband, as he apparently had been traveling and had not yet 
heard of those events. When the deputies tried to take his precious tomahawks, she also offered to 
hold onto them until he was released from his time in Sisika.

At this time, Governor Devine stepped in and confronted Laughing Eagle, asking why he was causing 
disturbances in "his town". (We leave it up to the reader to decide if the Governor can simply declare 
ownership of a town like Valentine.) Bringing up former Chief Red Dog, who was known to be harsh to 
Devine's government, he mused that the native should maybe follow in his footsteps and be hung for 
his crime. Devine then called him an "outlaw", a truly curious claim seeing as his own government 
recently passed legislation that legally defines an outlaw as someone who had been under a Wanted 
Bounty for over 72 hours, which clearly was not the case for this man.

Claiming that "outlaws" are not under the protection of the law, Governor Devine pulled out a gun 
and pointed it at Laughing Eagle's head, apparently ready to perform a summary execution himself. 
Miss Lockheart stepped in at this point, saying that the Governor does not have the power to mete 
out his own justice. He must treat the accused with respect and grant them a fair trial rather than 
simply decide to singlehandedly declare them an outlaw and perform an execution.

At this point, Governor Devine escalated the situation further, shockingly turning his gun on Miss 
Winnie herself with the words "Who the fuck are you?" Taken aback, she responded "I am Winifred 
Lockheart, currently running for Governor." Apparently realizing he'd crossed a line, Governor Devine
quickly holstered his gun and everyone was able to leave the jail without bloodshed.

This entire exchange was witnessed by five members of law enforcement, four of whom have been named 
in a lawsuit against the Governor filed on Saturday by Miss Lockheart's legal representative, Joshua 
JD Holliday. These individuals were Deputy Jackie Saber, Deputy Joda, Deputy Erickson, and Recruit 
Deputy Jessica Darsen.

Weevil News spoke with Winifred Lockheart after the incident and asked her to comment on how she 
felt about an elected politician intimidating and threatening people in New Alexandria. "The people 
should not be afraid of the government. The government should be afraid of the people. If I fought 
for four days to get justice (when they tried to cheat her out of being a candidate), and I fought 
to make sure a man wasn't summarily executed by the Governor outside the law, how hard will I fight 
for the people as Governor?"

The people of New Alexandria will have to await the upcoming trial to see if Governor Devine will 
be held accountable for his actions, but one thing is certain. His belief that he is above the law 
and his subsequent actions to take the law into his own hands have tarnished the reputation of New 
Alexandria's government. The lost trust in our political institutions will hopefully be restored 
with his departure from office following this weekend's election, which cannot come too soon.
