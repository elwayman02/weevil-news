The relationship between a woman and her horse can be a beautiful thing to behold. 
Such is the case with Mrs. Rose Young and her white arabian, Light Fury. Speaking 
to her moments before the Flat Iron Lake 500 on Saturday, Weevil News learned that 
she recently entered the racing scene to satisfy her horse's desire to run and compete.

After competing in her very first race this Wednesday at the Van Horn 400, Mrs. Young 
told us that she's not in it for the money, which will always go toward treats for 
her horse. She doesn't even think of other racers as competitors,  but just blocks 
them out and focuses on letting Light Fury run the track. To Rose, it's all about 
letting her horse have fun with each race.

For Wednesday's race, Light Fury flagged in the middle of the race after a strong early 
showing, but she didn't give up. Finding a second wind, the horse surged late in the race 
to the surprise of onlookers. Thanks to this valiant effort from her mount, Mrs. Young 
was able to pass one of the state's deputies for a solid second place finish, cementing 
her as one of the sport's new favorites.

Speaking about the upcoming race, we learned a bit about Rose's strategy. As an avid 
hunter alongside her husband, Matthew Young, Rose is used to handling her horse on 
tough woodlands terrain and making sharp turns while taking down bears and cougars. 
With the Flat Iron Lake race featuring two extremely tight turns on a short track, 
she was confident these skills would translate to victory on the day.

Mrs. Young also said she was rooting for her husband to do well in the day's race, 
after a disappointing last place finish in the Van Horn 400 because his horse Night Fury 
"absolutely hates him". She hopes that every racer is respectful and just lets their horses 
have fun, win or lose. It speaks to her strong relationship with her own horse that 
she's always focused on empathy for the horses themselves and not just the riders.
