Saturday's Flat Iron Lake 500 proved to have as many ups and downs as 
the trail from Annesburg to Coulter, leading to a finish that surprised and 
delighted onlookers. Running eight laps around a dual split in the trail north 
of the lake docks, this track proved to be a surprising challenge for all our 
competitors.

NAHRA President Eddie Collins oversaw the qualifying runs of the track, where each 
rider ran two laps and was timed for the second, used to determine starting positions 
in order of best to worst times. Speaking to racers ahead of the start, many appeared 
focused on the two sharp turns and wary of their horse stumbling over the wagon wheels 
jutting out on the corners.

At the start of the race, the poll positions were as follows: Dottie Tucker (Mouse), 
Rose Young (Light Fury), Matthew Young (Night Fury), Kitt Detwiler (Baron Von Beefcake), 
Thaddeus LeBlack (Charlie), Dr. Jaena Shaw (Little Brother), Ryan Hastings (Moxxie), 
and Dixie Tucker (Possum), with Maria Spacito bringing up the rear on 
Dee Lorian, formerly known as Tater. This highly experienced field featured two former 
winners and three others who had placed previously, as well as three who were running 
their first race.

Out of the gate, Rose Young pulled to a huge lead, with Dr. Shaw and Kitt Detwiler 
fighting for position distantly behind. Dixie Tucker fell asleep at the gate, her horse 
wandering off to the hillside with her dead dog on the back. Positions held fairly steady 
for the first half of the race, until Dr. Shaw closed the gap and began challenging 
Mrs. Young for first place as they came down the hillside into the second turn of Lap 3.

Unfortunately, tragedy struck going into the first turn of Lap 4, as Light Fury 
hip-checked Little Brother, who was making a pass on the inside. Stumbling over the wagon 
wheel, Dr. Shaw was thrown free and the pack trampled over her stunned horse through the 
turn. We learned after the race that Little Brother's injuries, while serious, will not end 
his racing career.

Light Fury began to flag heading uphill on the sixth lap, and Dottie Tucker's Mouse surged 
from the pack to take the lead with Night Fury closing in as well. After some confusion 
in the final lap over whether Maria Spacito had been lapped or made a miraculous surge 
from last place to victory, Dottie Tucker was declared the winner of the Flat Iron Lake 500! 
Matthew and Rose Young claimed paying finishes respectively, with the following order for 
the rest of the pack: Thaddeus LeBlanc, Kitt Detwiler, Ryan Hastings, Maria Spacito, 
Dr. Jaena Shaw (DNF), and Dixie Tucker (Disqualified).

Speaking with the winner afterward, Weevil News learned that not only was this Dottie's 
first race, she had also just purchased her horse earlier that day! In a truly miraculous 
show of bonding between rider and horse, she conserved Mouse's stamina and waited to push 
him until the last three laps. She looks forward to using her winnings to buy binoculars 
and a torch for herself and her sister Dixie. A generous statement of love from our humble 
winner!
