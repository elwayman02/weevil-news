Held southwest of Rhodes, Saturday's Braithwaite 400 became a historic race for the New Alexandria 
Horse Racing Association. A beautiful track down in the county of Lemoyne, this race featured a deep 
field of nine racers, including many experienced riders who have performed well in past events. 

The starting field was extremely exciting, with two shire horses posting the best qualifying times as 
Thatcher Ford (Mr. Horse) and Kevin Banks (Opie) claimed the front starting positions respectively. 
Representative-Elect Ada Lockwood started in third on her nokota Smokey, and Thadius LeBlanc rounded 
up the lead quartet on his turkoman Charlie.

The lone arabian in the race, Serious, started fifth with rider Saffron Mitchell at the reins. Coming 
off a decent performance last week, Georgia Banks (Rebel) looked to improve her finish coming from 
sixth position this time. Rounding out the field was Cyrus Jenkins on another shire, Ted, with the 
last two slots going to Luke Bourbon (Denim) and Sean McCree (Ranger).

With payouts of $400 for first place, $200 for second place, and $100 for third, excitement was high 
with onlookers cheering for their favorites to win. After a long and hard-fought race, the dust 
settled on a historic first - the victory went to a shire horse! Yes, Thatcher Ford and the shire 
he borrowed, Mr. Horse, managed to pull off the first-ever win for that breed. Even more 
convincingly, Kevin Banks and Opie redeemed their previous last-place finish to hold onto second 
for this race, the first time that *any* shire horses had finished in the money.

Taking home third prize was Thadius LeBlanc, a consistently solid NAHRA rider. Georgia Banks showed 
improvement as well, managing the race smartly to take fourth place on her turkoman. Surely not 
wanting to take the spotlight for herself after sponsoring her own event earlier in the week, 
Representative-Elect Lockwood still placed a respectable fifth in the field of nine. The rest of 
the results were as follows: Cyrus Jenkins (6th), Saffron Mitchell (7th), Luke Bourbon (8th), and 
Sean McCree (9th). Sponsored by Ford & Sons, the Braithwaite 400 turned out to be yet another 
intense, exciting event put on by Mr. Eddie Collins and his organization!
